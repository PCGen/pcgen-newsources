# Yolande's Shamanic Magic - SPecific Character:
Shamanic Magic (Yolande's)		CATEGORY:Special Ability	COST:10		TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.Ability.Extra	DESC:Path of the Dragon/Shaping (6), Pulse (6), and Heart of the Dragon II (18) (gather one spell level per round, may shape effects of up to L1), Specialized and Corrupted 1/3 Cost, User must call on spirits for magic other than Spirit Sight and Spirit Contact effects. Yolande may designate up to (Cha Mod + ECL/2 rounded up, 12 maximum) specific entities or general types of spirits to call on for appropriate types of magic, but each type may only be called on for a total of [(Cha Mod + ECL)/2 rounded up]spell levels' worth of magic before the user must rebuild her "pool" of "favors." Worse, the user may only renew such "pools" slowly. The user regains [(Cha Mod + ECL)/2 rounded up] points per day through minor rituals and respect for her spiritual patrons. She may also regain (Cha Mod) points by:	DESC:&nl; Fulfilling a special request from the Spirits. For example, fire spirits might want the user to arrange a fireworks display, while water spirits might want a spring cleaned out and purified. The user may simply ask the GM each day about possible tasks; there will usually be two or three available, but there's no guarantee that any of them will be even remotely practical.	DESC:&nl; Enacting a ritual in honor of some type of spirits. You might sit out in a storm meditating on its power for a night in honor of the air spirits, burn rare woods, incense, and oils in honor of the fire spirits, or conduct a religious ceremony in honor of outer-planar spirits.	DESC:&nl; Promising to undertake a later mission for the appropriate group of spirits. It's wise to take a few rounds to find out what they're going to want you to do, but sometimes people are just desperate.	DESC:&nl; Simply talking the spirits into it. This requires 1d4 hours of quiet meditation and a DC 18 Diplomacy or Knowledge/Religion check and can only be done once per day - although you can try until you do succeed . . .	DESC:&nl; Expending a Major Spirit Favor, up to once per day per spirit type.	DESC:&nl; Yolande's available entities include Air, Earth, Fire, and Nature spirits and the King of Stern Waters, who is also her fey patron for Witchcraft.


Leadership (Humans)													KEY:Leadership ~ Humans							SORTKEY:Leadership_1aa								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable																																																																																																																						DESC:(6 CP). You have relatively obedient human followers who are willing to follow your orders. In any case, you gain followers with a total ECL of (2 x [your level + your Cha Mod]) [Currently %1]. While none of them can have an ECL greater than (your character level - 3) or less than 1, you may otherwise allocate levels, and describe their personality traits and areas of expertise, as desired. Their equipment is up to the GM, but is usually typical for NPCs. Their levels may be increased, or additional followers may be added, as you go up in level; the Game Master should make adjustments. While followers are not slavishly loyal unless the character truly deserves such loyalty, they are reliable within reason. Lost followers can be replaced as long as the character is making a reasonable effort to do so and isn't abusing his or her followers; this will usually require 2d6 months.|2*(TL+CHA)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.35



#Atheria Skill Tiers:
#Tier-One Skills are quite often useful and are generally quite widely applicable. They include Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Int)*, Hide (Dex), Martial Arts (Varies), Movement Skills (Land/Tumble (Dex)*, Air/Fly (Dex), and Water/Swim (Str)), Move Silently (Dex), Profession/Occult (Wis)*, Search (Int), Sense/Spot (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex)*, Spellcraft (Int)*, and Survival (Wis). On Atheria all Knowledge Skills (Int) are Tier One - partly because they're important in general and partly because they include the knowledge of related magical rituals. Tier-One skills cost full price.

They include Appraise (Int) Balance (Dex), Bluff (Chr), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Control Shape (Wis), Craft/Exotic (Int)*, Escape Artist (Dex), Gather Information (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha)*, Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Open Lock (Dex)*, Perform (Specify) (Cha), Profession/Complex (Wis)*, Psicraft (Int)*, Ride (Dex), Sense/Listen (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Speak Language (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha)*.Tier Two skills are available for half cost.

#   Items marked with an "*" should be treated as exceptional physical abilities, and will operate in the Core. The rest of it relies on magic.
#Power Package (30 CP):

Spirit Fetch Template (94 CP/+2 ECL "Racial" Template)							KEY:Spirit Fetch Template_A			SORTKEY:Spirit Fetch Template_A									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.SpiritFetchTemplate																																										DESC:No Strength with the Incorporeal ability (12 CP).
Mystic Link with Master													KEY:Spirit Fetch Template_B			SORTKEY:Spirit Fetch Template_B									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.SpiritFetchTemplate																																										DESC:(3 CP), with the Communication (3 CP), Power (3 CP), and Summons (6 CP) Modifiers. This overlaps with several of the higher-level benefits of the Familiar bond, but that's not enough to be worth a price break.
Major Privilege/Spirit Messenger											KEY:Spirit Fetch Template_C			SORTKEY:Spirit Fetch Template_C									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.SpiritFetchTemplate																																										DESC:(6 CP). A Fetch will normally at least be given a hearing by most entities in the various spirit worlds and outer planes - and is normally treated as a neutral messenger, rather than as a target. Major Spirit Favors with +6 Bonus Uses (15 CP).
Immunity/having to pay back magical spirit favors at full value						KEY:Spirit Fetch Template_D			SORTKEY:Spirit Fetch Template_D									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.SpiritFetchTemplate																																										DESC:(Very Common, Major, Minor, 10 CP): Since the Spirit Fetch provides the channel, rather than forcing the spirit called upon to project it's powers across the dimensions, working through a Fetch means that magical favors are very little trouble for spirits to provide - and so require only occasional, or relatively small, favors to repay. Still, spirits will occasionally call on the Fetch's master when they need something done in the material world.
Immunity/dimensional barriers												KEY:Spirit Fetch Template_E			SORTKEY:Spirit Fetch Template_E									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.SpiritFetchTemplate																																										DESC:(Very Common, Severe, Major, 18 CP): The spirit fetch can move between the dimensions - although this may take it some time; being able to breach the dimensional boundaries doesn't mean that it may not be a fairly long trip.
Shapeshift															KEY:Spirit Fetch Template_F			SORTKEY:Spirit Fetch Template_F									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.SpiritFetchTemplate																																										DESC:with the Incorporeal Modifier (this modifier is normally used by physical creatures to take incorporeal forms, but it will work perfectly well the other way), Specialized/only to materialize, not to take alternate forms (6 CP).
Extraordinary Returning													KEY:Spirit Fetch Template_G			SORTKEY:Spirit Fetch Template_G									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.SpiritFetchTemplate																																										DESC:(12 CP). "Destroying" a Spirit Fetch normally requires permanently killing off it's master; otherwise it will be back within a week. Fortunately, this also negates the usual penalties of having a "familiar" destroyed.

# Thunder Dwarf
Tied to the Earth																														CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseRacialOutput																						DESC:The Persistent metamagic theorem, Specialized in Improved Persistent (giving spells a roughly 24-hour duration, 3 CP), with two levels of Streamline, Specialized in Persistent (12 CP). Essentially, all their spells with durations are tied into the energies of the earth, and have effective durations of twenty-four hours.
The Thunder Forge																														CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseRacialOutput																						DESC:Channeling (technically of elemental forces) 9 Uses/Day, Specialized/only for spell conversion, plus Spell Conversion/Four spells of up to level six related to a particular elemental theme. Both are Corrupted/the "user" is deeply tied to the elemental forces of the world. The local environmental conditions will affect his or her moods, he or she must make fortitude saves against Dispel and Anti-magical effects to resist being stunned for 1d4 rounds, and he or she can be easily detected by appropriate senses (15 CP). Note that, for effects with durations, the Tied to the Earth ability is effective.
The Thunder Forge ~ Elemental Mastery															OUTPUTNAME:Elemental Mastery							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseRacialOutput																						DESC:May produce any effect related to their element of up to level three (L3 base, +2 levels for any spell within a limited theme, +1 level for local casting requirements).
The Thunder Forge ~ Spellbinding																OUTPUTNAME:Spellbinding								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseRacialOutput																						DESC:Allows the user to bind a spell of up to level three into a dust, potion, or small charm. Such a spell can be released by some simply action - drinking or applying the potion, scattering the dust, rubbing or breaking the talisman, or using a command word - as specified when the item is created. Sadly, the ingredients may still be a bit bothersome to come up with and this still costs (Spell Level x Caster Level x 2) xP.

This is a variant on the basic Summon-into-yourself routine effect from The Practical Enchanter, although it's "summoning" raw elemental power rather than an actual elemental spirit. The effects, however, are almost identical (a L5 effect, +1 level for local casting requirements).																																																																																																																																																																																		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|The Thunder Forge ~ Elemental Bond I|The Thunder Forge ~ Elemental Bond II|The Thunder Forge ~ Elemental Bond III

The Thunder Forge ~ Elemental Bond I															OUTPUTNAME:Sense and Analyze Affinity Items				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseRacialOutput																						DESC:The ability to sense and analyze items and occult energies within his or her affinity. Thus a dwarf attuned to the Earth Thunder can sense the structure of stone and metal in the immediate vicinity, sense coming earthquakes and eruptions, sense flaws in stone structures and their foundations, and detect and evaluate earth magic in the immediate vicinity.

ABILITY:Character Points|AUTOMATIC|Damage Reduction ~ 3(All)
Short Legs																															CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseRacialOutput																						DESC:Thunder Dwarves tend to be short and solid, and have relatively short arms and legs. While this is rarely a major factor, it does reduce their base movement by 10, although this is not cumulative with the effects of armor and encumbrance (a -3 CP Disadvantage).

Bestial Form (Ikam)																		OUTPUTNAME:Bestial Form								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseRacialOutput																						DESC:Thanks to their natural Mana, the Ikam are born with some features drawn from the dominant predators in the local environment - usually minor natural adaptions - and somewhat animalistic forms (in the Twilight Isles they get scales, improved claws, and better fangs). This is a lesser variation on Alter Self, an animalistic appearance (or more of one than they'd have anyway) (1400 GP).

Ikam Disadvantage																														CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseRacialOutput																						DESC:The power of the Ikam leaks into their blood and words. They are bound by their oaths, and may become accursed if they violate such a bond (although, on rare occasions, their power channels itself through an oath and helps them fulfill it). Their blood and flesh can be used for many magical purposes. Their tales are mesmerizing, and can evoke their topics - or at least illusions thereof - quite accidently. They find it difficult to lie (-10 penalty) without the magical distortions giving them away. These problems fade a little (although they never go away) as their excessive Mana converts itself to Power (-1 Mana for +3 Power), a process which occurs naturally as they age or focus on their psychic development. While the process is irreversible, their basic mana level will never drop below one-quarter of what they started with. (44 CP).

Blessing/ Specialized for Grant of Aid only and Corrupted (extremely flashy in use)			KEY:Blessing ~ Grant Of Aid Specialized and Corrupted																									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extra.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable																																																																																											DESC:(2 CP). Blessing allows you to give others abilities equal to your own. Although powerful and versatile, Blessing comes with built-in flaws: you can only bless others when your abilities exceed theirs, and you lose the difference. As an alternative, the user may opt to "share" a particular item slot and the benefits of whatever occupies it. ! For example, a character with Blessing and +8 BAB could give another character with +5 BAB the difference. His or her BAB would then fall to +5. The Blessing lasts for 24 hours without being renewed, and the "Blesser" may take back his or her abilities at any time. The Blessing ends if either dies.

### Halloween Special Abilities:
The Adamant Heart				TYPE:Halloween Abilities.EclipseAbilityOutput	CATEGORY:Special Ability	COST:6	DESC: &nl;Flesh that has already endured the touch of death and returned is not so easily forced to give up the ghost again, and can endure shocks that would destroy a creature not so fortified. Luck with +8 Bonus Uses, Specialized and Corrupted/only to "Take 20" on saves against massive damage (6 CP).
Bond of Blood				TYPE:Halloween Abilities.EclipseAbilityOutput	CATEGORY:Special Ability	COST:6	DESC: &nl;When you wound a creature you may tear away a tiny portion of its very essence, giving you a magical link to him, her, or it. Immunity/the need to actually touch someone to deliver touch-based effects (Common, Major, Great, Specialized and Corrupted/can only be focused on one creature at a time, to change the target the user must wound a new target). The user need not change targets whenever he or she wounds a creature though; establishing the link is a voluntary act. The link may only be used three times per day (6 CP).
The Crawling Hand				TYPE:Halloween Abilities.EclipseAbilityOutput	CATEGORY:Special Ability	COST:6	DESC: &nl;Your time among the dead has taught you that the body is a mere vessel for the spirit - and the spirit is not entirely bound by space. You may detach body parts and still treat them as a part of you. Immunity/distance between body parts (Common, Severe, Minor [works within long range and offers protection from 12 points of slashing damage per attack]) (6 CP). Yes, this means that you can "cut off your head" as a party trick.
Deathcrafter				TYPE:Halloween Abilities.EclipseAbilityOutput	CATEGORY:Special Ability	COST:6	DESC: &nl;Any undead you create will be considerably more powerful than usual, gaining any of a wide selection of bonuses. The Amplify Metamagic Theorem plus the Glory and Finesse (to base the Glory effect on the user's spellcasting attribute). Specialized and Corrupted/only applies to necromancy spells, only applies to spells that create undead. Typical results include +4 Str, +4 Dex, +2 AC, +2 HP/Die, +2 to Saves, +2 to the damage they inflict, and similar modifiers. The user can normally apply one such modifier per point of his spellcasting attribute modifier.
Disrupted Eidolon				TYPE:Halloween Abilities.EclipseAbilityOutput	CATEGORY:Special Ability	COST:6	DESC: &nl;The character is not really a part of reality any longer, and can make no lasting impression upon it's substance. Lesser spells and powers, and even photographs and paint, cannot record the characters existence or actions. His or her words and deeds will fade from transcripts or be attributed to others, images will vanish or turn into other people, and he or she will persist only in living memory. Good if you want to evade scrying, security cameras, or taxes, bad if you want to be remembered or get into an old bank account. Fortunately, records which existed before the character acquired this ability are unaffected. Immunity / Recording and Remote Detection (Common / Minor / Major, 6 CP).
Echoes of Mortality			TYPE:Halloween Abilities.EclipseAbilityOutput	CATEGORY:Special Ability	COST:6	DESC: &nl;While few positive emotions linger in the undead, and often little of their past lives, the knack of playing upon what reminiscence exists is given to a few who have touched upon the worlds beyond themselves. Immunity/the normal restrictions on using social skills and interactions on the undead, although they usually start off hostile (Uncommon, Minor, Legendary, Specialized/only works if the user has either found out who the undead creature they're dealing with was before becoming undead OR has the leisure to talk for several minutes about the wonders of life), Corrupted/the effects are usually temporary, most undead will shrug off the effects within a few hours (4 CP), plus Skill Emphasis/Diplomacy, similarly Specialized and Corrupted (1 CP), plus Speak Language/Grave Argot, the "common tongue" of undead and the negative plane (1 CP).
Flame of Life				TYPE:Halloween Abilities.EclipseAbilityOutput	CATEGORY:Special Ability	COST:6	DESC: &nl;Filled with the energies which have recalled him or her to life, a character with the Flame of Life burning within them can easily shrug off the attacks of the Undead. Grant of Aid with +8 Bonus Uses, Specialized and Corrupted/only usable to shrug off the effects of attacks by the undead, can only be used once per round. The user may recover 1d8+5 damage, 1d3 points of attribute damage, or one negative level 9+Level/3 times per day as a free action - provided that such damage was inflicted by an undead creature (6 CP).
Khaibit					TYPE:Halloween Abilities.EclipseAbilityOutput	CATEGORY:Special Ability	COST:6	DESC: &nl;The characters shadow becomes a Shadow in truth, a portion of his or her inner darkness given form and manifestation. Companion Creature, Corrupted to increase the CR of creature that may be used as a base/the user's personal shadow can't spawn additional shadows, cannot be trusted when operating unsupervised or at long ranges, and cannot separate itself from it's master in brightly lit conditions (6 CP).
Knell of the Reaper			TYPE:Halloween Abilities.EclipseAbilityOutput	CATEGORY:Special Ability	COST:6	DESC: &nl;When you achieve a critical hit, or slay, an opponent in combat, you do so in such a dramatic fashion - whether due to good old-fashioned gore or some supernatural effect - that nearby opponents will become Shaken. Presence/Aura of Fear (Doom effect), Specialized and Corrupted for increased radius (30 feet)/only works when you achieve a critical hit or kill someone, opponents may make a Will save versus (11 + User's Cha Mod) to resist the effect.
Planar Channel				TYPE:Halloween Abilities.EclipseAbilityOutput	CATEGORY:Special Ability	COST:6	DESC: &nl;While you have returned from death, you remain strongly linked to the outer plane which received your spirit. When you summon creatures which are not already linked to an opposing plane, you infuse them with a portion of the energies of that outer plane, granting them various enhancements. Leadership with Emperor's Star x2 (+2 positive levels, with effects specified when this ability is purchased), Specialized and Corrupted/grants no actual followers, but only applies to summoned creatures, only on creatures of unopposed alignment types (6 CP).
Puppet from Beyond			TYPE:Halloween Abilities.EclipseAbilityOutput	CATEGORY:Special Ability	COST:6	DESC: &nl;Some who return from death find themselves trapped between the worlds, able to manifest a body - pulling together stray bits of matter, possessing and transforming a corpse, or some such - and strongly linked to that form, but unable to fully pass into the living world, Still, this has it's advantages; mere physical damage may destroy the body that they are currently operating, but they will find or create another soon enough. Extraordinary Returning (user must be slain by effects that drain or snuff out his or her life force, hunted down between the planes, or spiritually imprisoned to prevent him or her from simply creating another body later on), Specialized/the user's body is instantly destroyed at zero hit points and it will require some weeks to create a new one, in the meantime, effects which rely on having some portion of the user's true body to work with will not be able to bring him or her back or be otherwise effective (6 CP).
Seeing the Wings of Death		TYPE:Halloween Abilities.EclipseAbilityOutput	CATEGORY:Special Ability	COST:6	DESC: &nl;All things are ultimately subject to death and destruction, entropy is not to be denied. Having experienced true death, characters with this knack can see the transient possibilities of it that constantly spread out before any creature in battle - and, while his or her strength of will and focus endures, can choose some of those possibilities to make real, "taking 20" on an attack or critical-confirmation roll up to five times per day. Luck with +4 Bonus Uses, Specialized/only for attacks (6 CP).
Spectral Stride				TYPE:Halloween Abilities.EclipseAbilityOutput	CATEGORY:Special Ability	COST:6	DESC: &nl;You may briefly abandon your hold on the material plane, to once more become a free spirit. Shapeshift with the Shape of Death and Incorporeal Forms enhancements, Specialized and Corrupted/Incorporeal Form can only be safely maintained for (Wisdom) rounds, after that, resisting the siren call of the afterworlds to return to the material realm requires a Will check at a DC equal to the number of rounds you are already past your limit. If the user fails three such checks in a row, he or she will depart for the afterworlds (6 CP).
Spirit not Flesh				TYPE:Halloween Abilities.EclipseAbilityOutput	CATEGORY:Special Ability	COST:6	DESC: &nl;For some of those who return from death, it is the strength of their spirits and the flow of positive energy from beyond that grants them warmth and animation. For them, the flesh is not so vital as the strength of their will. Immunity/Critical Hits and Sneak Attacks (Common, Major, Major, Corrupted/only applies to the extra damage from the critical hit or sneak attack), reducing it by 30 points. The base damage applies normally (6 CP).
Undying Devotion				TYPE:Halloween Abilities.EclipseAbilityOutput	CATEGORY:Special Ability	COST:6	DESC: &nl;Your dedication to your cause, lord, or other focus is incorruptible. No occult force or honeyed words can sway you from it. Immunity/mind-controlling effects, including social manipulations (Common, Major, Major, Specialized for double effect [protects against effects of up to level ten] and Corrupted). This immunity only works against attempts to use persuasion or emotional manipulation to override loyalties, not against morale bonuses and penalties, hold effects, attempts to persuade the user that something is indeed a good idea, or any other form of manipulation (6 CP).
The Wandering Soul			TYPE:Halloween Abilities.EclipseAbilityOutput	CATEGORY:Special Ability	COST:6	DESC: &nl;You soul has been drawn back into the world, but the connection between it and your body is not at all firm; it has manifested independently, and has a tendency to wander off on it's own in the guise of some minor creature. Fortunately, that means that if your body is destroyed, it's a shock, but hardly lethal. Companion (Familiar), with Transform. Specialized/the Transformation cannot be turned off; most people will take the Companion for you and vice-versa (6 CP).
