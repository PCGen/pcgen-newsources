#Martial Arts Description Abilities
Nightmare Storm Martial Art	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SORTKEY:A1	TYPE:MartialArtsOutput		DESC:This martial art focuses on channeling negative energy into the user's hands and weapons, allowing him or her to cleave through armor to hit more accurately, absorb the energy of incoming blows with his or her bare skin, sense the life energy of foes, cause them to crumple when struck, and to disrupt their bodies with a mere touch. It is, however, a terrible strain on the metabolism of a living creature	DESC:Basic Abilities; Attack 4, Defenses 3, Strike, Synergy/Channeling Checks. Advanced and Master Techniques; Blind-Fight, Mighty Blow, Reach, and Weapon Kata (Pick). Occult Techniques; Inner Strength x2, Paralyze, and Touch Strike.
Obsidian Heart Kung Fu		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SORTKEY:A1	TYPE:MartialArtsOutput		DESC:Obsidian Heart Kung Fu is a purely mystical form which progresses from simple evasion and awareness of the user's surroundings (basic Defenses and Mind Like Moon) on to generating a seething aura of negative energy around the user - an amorphous, quasi-solid thing which lashes out to strike at opponents or deflect incoming attacks while the user remains virtually immobile. At it's highest levels, the user may even support or move his or her own body with the aura, allowing him or her to accomplish some fairly impressive feats - although this comes at a considerable cost to his or her energy reserves. Basics; Attack 4, Defenses 4, Power 2, Strike, Synergy/Hide, Synergy/Move Silently. Advanced and Master Techniques; Reach, Mind Like Moon (may avoid being surprised or caught flat-footed with a DC 15 reflex save), Breaking (may add martial arts skill to the strength check when trying to break objects), Expertise (May transfer up to five points from attack bonus to armor class as a dodge bonus if making an attack). Occult Techniques; Inner Strength, Ki Block, Light Foot, and Vanishing.
Sardorian Archery Style		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SORTKEY:A1	TYPE:MartialArtsOutput		DESC:The Sardorian Style focuses on military discipline. Ignore distractions, remain calm, draw smoothly, focus on your target, release, and repeat. Trust your allies to keep the enemy troops off you and use volley fire to deal with major opponents.  Unfortunately, since arrows have distinct limitations as weapons (at least for more-or-less normal people in a d20 universe), be prepared to fall back and switch to a different weapon.  Basics; Attack 4, Power 2, Synergy/Craft (Bowyer), Synergy/Hide, and Toughness 2. Advanced and Master Techniques; Deflect Arrows, Rapid Shot, Mighty Blow, and +1d6 Sneak Attack. Occult Techniques; Inner Strength, Ki Focus, Serpent Strike, and Touch Strike.

# Rithian Blade Master ~ Package Deal
Rithian Blademaster Package Deal	COST:0	KEY:Rithian Blade Master	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.PackageDeals	DESC:The Rithian Blademasters are one of the oldest and most respected warrior-orders of the western realm. While they have several rival schools, the purity of the Rithian techniques is unquestioned and the honor of their school has been fiercely maintained across the centuries. More than a few great champions have come from their halls. They will NOT be pleased to hear that an undead horror is using, and abusing, their techniques, and will certainly sponsor efforts to eliminate such a dishonor.	ABILITY:Character Points|AUTOMATIC|Rithian Blade Master ~ Package Deal	COST:0	

Block/Melee (4 CP) with Multiple (4 CP) and Riposte (4 CP), all Corrupted/only usable while using a sword.

Given Borez's horrific Reflex save, he can generally pretty well count on deflecting two melee attacks - and getting two extra attacks of his own - every round that he's in melee as long as his opponents can hit him at all.

Greater Undead Package			COST:64	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extra.EclipseAbilityOutput	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE.GreaterUndeadPackage	DESC: &nl;All of these effects are Specialized - the user becomes an undead horror, seeks to prey on the living, becomes vulnerable to being Turned (Channeling), and will find it essentially impossible to turn away from evil without dying. This does mean that a couple of the defenses are double-specialized, but - in this case - the effects don't overlap, and so I'll give permission for that.

As a side effect, they regain 10 HP whenever they would normally suffer a negative level, but treat Positive Levels as negative levels.

Infernal Command Package	COST:58												KEY:Knight of Hades ~ Infernal Command							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extra.EclipseAbilityOutput.KnightHadesTemplate		DESC:Newly-recruited Knights of Hades are generally powerful warriors, but usually lack the ability to cast, or effectively counter, spells. To counter this weakness, they are granted the direct command over magical energies. That doesn't give them any particularly sophisticated effects to call on, but it certainly gives them a variety of options.	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE.KnightHadesTemplateInfernal

Inherent Spells																KEY:Knight of Hades ~ Inherent Spells							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extra.EclipseAbilityOutput.KnightHadesTemplateInfernal		DESC:12xL1 (12 CP), 8x L2 (15 CP), 8x L3 (17 CP), 8x L4 (17 CP), and 8x L5 (17 CP). All Specialized and Corrupted: Only usable to power Theurgy, immediate commands only, blatantly displays the user's nature when used via a burst of infernal energies (incidentally negating any attempt at stealth), attracts the notice of various powers of light. Caster Level = User's Level, Save DC is Charisma based. Net cost= 26 CP.
Metamagic/Easy and Metamagic/Elemental Manipulation with the Fast modifier and four levels of Streamline	KEY:Knight of Hades ~ Metamagic								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extra.EclipseAbilityOutput.KnightHadesTemplateInfernal		DESC:all Specialized and Corrupted/Only works to Quicken his spells and to change the damage of damage-causing spells to Profane/Negative Energy damage, requires the patronage of the greater powers of the lower planes, who WILL demand regular services and offerings, must possess - and prominently display - a very expensive (2500 GP+) bejeweled unholy symbol to gain this enhancement (14 CP).
Mastery x2/all Theurgy Verb Skills													KEY:Knight of Hades ~ Mastery x2 all Theurgy Verb Skills				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extra.EclipseAbilityOutput.KnightHadesTemplateInfernal		DESC:Specialized for Double Effect (may "Take 20")/Immediate commands only; No long-term enchantments, duration spells, triggered or waiting effects, etc (12 CP).

# That gives our Knights of Hades a total template cost of 160 CP - in +4 ECL territory. If you're converting a character into a Knight of Hades in Eclipse, simply add that to his or her racial package, eliminate any overlapping or conflicting elements (such as a Constitution bonus or Penalty), and see what you wind up with.

#   If you start with a normal human though, you'll still wind up with a +4 ECL modifier.



###Block: Sample Relics

# Torc of the Deceiver
Shapeshift, with Shape of Death					KEY:Torc of the Deceiver ~ Shapeshift							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.TorcOfTheDeceiver		DESC:Specialized and Corrupted/only allows shifting into a normal human and is essentially cosmetic. The user seems quite normal and can eat, drink, and enjoy the other pleasures of life - but his or her actual game statistics are unchanged. Unfortunately, any major use of dark powers (such as his Infernal Command abilities) will burn away the quasi-illusory shell like tissue paper (4 CP).
Advanced Shape of Death/the user may become Incorporeal	KEY:Torc of the Deceiver ~ Advanced Shape of Death					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.TorcOfTheDeceiver		DESC:Corrupted/this state can only be sustained for a few minutes at a time (4 CP).

# The Shard of Dust
Channeling/Conversion to a Level Five Effect		KEY:The Shard of Dust ~ Channeling	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.ShardOfDust		DESC:(9 CP). The spell is Dust of Ages - a version of Animate Dead that requires neither gems nor bodies. Unfortunately, the lack of a solid structure means that the creatures called forth are unstable, and will return to the dust from which they were summoned after 1d4+1 hours.

Immunity/the distinction between weapons and himself			KEY:ABT ~ Immunity			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extra.EclipseAbilityOutput.ABT		DESC:(Common, Minor, Major, Specialized in Swords, 3 CP). For true blademasters, their weapons are truly extensions of themselves; attempts to sunder or disarm them are simply treated as normal attacks against hem, and any touch-based powers and "unarmed" combat enhancements or martial arts which they may possess operate through their blades.
Reflex Training/Combat Reflexes Variant					KEY:ABT ~ Reflex				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extra.EclipseAbilityOutput.ABT		DESC:(6 CP). He gets five attacks of opportunity per round.

Immunity to Dispelling, Antimagic, and Countermagic	KEY:Immunity ~ AnekBorez							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.TheLesserMastery		DESC:(Common/Minor/Great). Specialized in protecting innate enchantments only, Corrupted/only covers powers in this package (4 CP)

# A great many campaigns will limit characters to 11,000 GP worth of Innate Enchantments - enough to grant characters some interesting and useful powers, and to make them considerably more likely to survive at lower levels, but not enough to make any really major changes at high levels. This batch of abilities would normally cost 880 XP to activate - but we don't really need to worry about that in an NPC.

Blessings of the Darkness	COST:24		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.AnekBorez	DESC: &nl;Long decades of service and honor as a mortal had earned Borez several blessings - some modest portion of the powers of a true Paladin. Of course - as often happens when a mortal finds such a path too difficult to follow and turns to darkness - the powers of the lower planes were more than happy to replace those lost blessings.


Improved Augmented Bonus / CHA for Reflex Save	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.AnekBorez			DESC: &nl;May add his (Cha Mod) to his Reflex Saving Throws, Specialized/only works as long as he continues to enjoy the favor of the dark powers (6 CP).

Luck with +4 Bonus Uses					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.AnekBorez				COST:12	DESC: &nl;A lucky character may either "Take 20" in advance, without taking extra time and whether or not this would usually be allowed, or reroll after the primary roll once per day. Most characters also get Bonus Uses.

The Lure of the Night	COST:12		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.AnekBorez		DESC:This isn't a tremendous amount of power - although the ability to simply create his weapons and armor on the spot is pretty handy - but it is a good deal more than most villagers ever get, it's fairly versatile, and it can be used without destroying his disguise. It's also something that he can offer to teach new recruits. Besides, the small illusions - and the ability to deceive divination effects - both come in very handy in masking his true nature.

###Block: The Ancient One

The Ancient One (+2 ECL)			KEY:Ancient One ~ The Ancient One		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.Template_Ancient_One.Template_Ancient_Onex		SORTKEY:Ancient_One_a			DESC:The basic "Ancient One" has "lived" two to four "prior lives", and - most often - "started out" as a beast or as a talisman-making shaman or some such. Since this is pretty obviously an acquired template to be stacked over an existing race, it's been built with a total of 64 CP - making it a +2 ECL template over whatever it's applied to.
Prior "Lives"					KEY:Ancient One ~ Prior Lives			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.Template_Ancient_One.Template_Ancient_Onex		SORTKEY:Ancient_One_b			DESC:+3 Specialities in each of three times and places where the character "previously lived". These can usually be applied to rolls related to events during the period, cultural questions, and general knowledge of the period.

Branch Pounce	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Combat.General.Abilities.EclipseAbilityOutput	DESC:You are adept at exploiting higher ground to its greatest advantage in battle, and can leap from above to deal incredible damage to your foes.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Climb 3 ranks, Stealth 3 ranks.		BENEFIT:When charging a target by jumping down from above (such as when jumping out of a tree), you can soften your fall with a melee attack. If the attack at the end of your charge hits, the attack deals damage as normal and you also deal the amount of falling damage appropriate to your fall to the target (1d6 points for a 10-foot fall, 2d6 points for a 20-foot fall, and so on). This falling damage is not multiplied on a critical hit. You land in an unoccupied square of your choosing adjacent to the target, and you take falling damage as if your fall had been 10 feet shorter. You can attempt an Acrobatics check as normal to treat the fall as an additional 10 feet shorter for the purpose of determining the damage you take from the fall. If your attack misses, you land prone in a random square adjacent to the target and automatically take the full amount of falling damage.	COST:6
