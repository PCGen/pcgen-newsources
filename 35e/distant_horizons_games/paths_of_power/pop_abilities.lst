Channeling (Available to all alignments save TN)
# Channeling draws on the energies of the outer planes, hence its effects are alignment-dependent. Channeling does not affect True Neutral characters at all, is beneficial to those whose alignments are within one step of the casters, has no effect on those whose alignments have both a matching and an opposing component, and will harm those with one or more opposing components and no matching ones. For example, a LG channeler will heal LN, LG, and NG creatures, will not affect CG, LE, and TN creatures, and will actively harm NE, CE, and CN creatures. Game masters often opt to limit the Channeling list to Divine spellcasters, but we’ve left the option open to arcane casters. After all, each spell used for healing is one less that can be used to massacre the opposition.
1 Cure/Inflict Light Wounds: Cures 1d8 damage +1/level (max +5) or inflicts a similar amount.
2 Cure/Inflict Moderate Wounds: Cures 2d8 damage +1/level (max +10) or inflicts a similar amount.
3 Cure/Inflict Serious Wounds: Cures 3d8 damage +1/level (max +15) or inflicts a similar amount.
4 Cure/Inflict Critical Wounds: Cures 4d8 damage +1/level (max +20) or inflicts a similar amount.
5 Cure/Inflict Light Wounds, Mass: Cures 1d8 damage +1/level (max +25) or inflicts a similar amount for many creatures.
6 Heal/Harm: Cures 10 points/level of damage and all diseases and mental conditions or inflicts a similar amount of damage.
7 Regenerate/Wither: Subject’s severed limbs grow back, cures 4d8 damage +1/level (max +35) or withers one randomly-selected limb into uselessness and inflicts a similar amount.
8 Cure Critical Wounds, Mass: Cures 4d8 damage +1/level (max +40) or inflicts a similar amount for many creatures.
9 Heal/Harm, Mass: As heal, but with several subjects.

Earthward (Available to TN characters only)
Earthward spells call on the forces of the earth to ward off injury, at first to the caster, later on to those in a modest radius. One Earthward spell can be cast per round as a free action, on or off initiative.

1 Minor Earthward:* Protects the caster from 1d8 +1/level (max +5) damage from any single attack.
2 Lesser Earthward:* Protects the caster from 2d8 +1/level (max +10) damage from any single attack.
3 Earthward:* Protects the caster from 3d8 damage +1/level (max +15) from any single attack or from any single special damage effect, such as poison or energy drain.
4 Greater Earthward:* Protects the caster from 4d8 damage +1/level (max +20) damage from any single attack and prevents any special damage effects from that attack, such as poison or energy drain.
5 Minor Earthward, Mass:* As per Minor Earthward, but protects to many creatures.

Neutrality Domain
# This domain is powerful, but somewhat rigid in application. Some of its spells, while similar to other alignment spells, have been weakened because of their potential utility. Remember that these spells, like other alignment domains, only work at all at the sufferance of the GM – if she refuses to provide the proper enemies, these spells will not work.
“I have weighed you in the balance and found you wanting.”
Domain Power: The Ward of Neutrality. The character declares the use of this ability as a free action; all attempts to summon non-neutral creatures within 60’ automatically fail. All outsiders with extreme alignments within 60’ must make a Will save (DC 10+character’s cleric level +Wisdom bonus) or be returned to their native plane, unless they are already magically barred from leaving. This effect lasts for 1/turn per cleric level.
1 Protection from Extremes:* +2 to AC and saves, counter mind control, hedge out elementals and outsiders.
2 Return to Nature:* Destroy corpse or large section of organic material
3 Magic Circle against Extremes:* As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level.
4 Rational Discussion:* Temporarily suppresses alignments within a 20-ft radius for 10 min./level.
5 Dispel Extremes:* +4 bonus against attacks by extreme creatures.
6 Balance in All Things:* Damage dealt to caster is copied back to attacker
7 Word of Balance:* Kills, paralyzes, weakens, or dazes extreme subjects.
8 Woodland Shield:* +4 Saves, SR 25 against nonneutral aligned spells spells.
