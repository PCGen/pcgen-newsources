Norn Template									SOURCEPAGE:p.48				PRETEXT:Humanoid or Goblinoid
#Languages: Wolf; the Norn may communicate with Winter Wolves and normal wolves by speech and body language. Granted, wolves don't talk a whole lot anyway.
#Paths: A Norn may choose between his or her prior racial path and the Winter Wolf path when receiving this template.
#Resistances: The Norn gains cold resistance 2; in addition, he or she gains +2 on any saving throw verses cold effects.
#Spell Effect: A Norn always has a Longstrider effect when loping across open arctic wasteland.
#Special: A Norn must make a Will save (DC 20) to attack a Winter Wolf. In addition, he or she must make the same saving throw to attack any member of his or her 'pack', which usually includes his or her party members. Illusions and images thereof do not count if the Norn recognizes their false nature. Usually, a single Winter Wolf controls a pack of Norns, and they must make a DC 15 check to disobey that one specific Winter Wolf in anything. Norn player characters usually have left the service of their Winter Wolf (or it died).
#Note: the essential purpose of this template isn't to fundamentally alter the character, but to adapt one to severe cold conditions. The Norns themselves have little to distinguish them from normal members of their species, except in behavior.
