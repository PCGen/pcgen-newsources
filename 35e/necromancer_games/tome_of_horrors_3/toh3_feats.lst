##
Healing Shift
When a therianthrope shifts forms, it heals a
limited amount of damage.
Prerequisites: Therianthrope.
Benefit: When a therianthrope changes forms,
it immediately heals a number of hit points equal
to its total character level (Hit Dice plus any class
levels). This does not function if the therianthrope
is slain (and reverts back to its animal form). This
feat is usable once per day.
Normal: Therianthropes do not regain lost hit
points for changing forms.

Quicken Shift
A therianthrope can change forms slightly faster
than normal.
Prerequisites: Therianthrope, Int 13+.
Benefit: When a therianthrope changes forms it
does so as a move action.
Normal: Changing forms is a standard action.
