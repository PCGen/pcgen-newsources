Accursed						KEY:Disadvantage ~ Accursed						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESC:The universe is out to get you. This covers literal curses, such as dooming those you love, terrible fates, bleeding fire instead of blood, or uncontrollable lycanthropy, as well as lesser, persistent annoyances. The latter might include being a preferred target for attacks (you count as two people if random targeting is used), unpleasant disabilities such as epilepsy, allergies and so on. Your curse can be lifted, but it requires a great deal of work or truly major magic.					MULT:YES	CHOOSE:USERINPUT|TITLE="Accursed"																			COST:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.18
Aged							KEY:Disadvantage ~ Aged							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESC:You didn't take up adventuring until late in life. You are middle-aged or older and may, at the option of the GM, have an extra level or two with the points assigned to abilities of little use in adventuring - giving you a starting edge at the cost of a long-term penalty.																																																																	COST:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.18
Blocked						KEY:Disadvantage ~ Blocked						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESC:You cannot use some type of ability to which you'd normally have access. This is commonly a magical school, but this may include racial abilities or class abilities in games which use classes.

Broke							KEY:Disadvantage ~ Broke						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESC:You start with only a third of the usual cash and equipment you would be entitled to by your level.

COST:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.18
Compulsive						KEY:Disadvantage ~ Compulsive						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESC:You have some particular mania or "code of conduct" which influences everything you do. Likely compulsions include the classic manias (like Pyro- or Klepto-), an overwhelming love or hatred, greed, dedication to some peculiar goal, truthfulness, extravagent spending, or even virtue. Codes include things like Hippocratic Oaths or Chivalry. Characters that ignore their compulsions take a 20%% experience penalty.																MULT:YES	CHOOSE:USERINPUT|TITLE="Compulsive"																			COST:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.18
Dependent						KEY:Disadvantage ~ Dependent						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESC:There is something you just have to have to function effectively. You could be addicted to a drug, rely on a special talisman, require constant support and encouragement, or simply be so confused that you need someone to tell you what to do. Unless there's a specific effect involved this defaults to a -3 penalty on your rolls.																														MULT:YES	CHOOSE:USERINPUT|TITLE="Dependent on What"																	COST:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.18
Foolish						KEY:Disadvantage ~ Foolish						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESC:You don't learn as quickly as usual, and so take a 20%% experience point penalty.

Frail							KEY:Disadvantage ~ Frail						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESC:You must make a (DC 18) Fortitude save after casting a spell of level 3+ or fighting for three rounds. On a failure you take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and become staggered for 1d4 rounds.

Hallucinations, Flashbacks, and Visions	KEY:Disadvantage ~ Hallucinations Flashbacks and Visions	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESC:Your version of reality doesn't always agree with that of those about you. While this is common enough with respect to details, in your case it may extend to things like whether it's daytime. More commonly, and most dangerously, you may simply see a distorted version of what everyone else sees. This is up to the GM, but the occasional Will save (DC 18) is suggested, or you may react in a radically different manner than those about you.

Healing Resistant					KEY:Disadvantage ~ Healing Resistant				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESC:You get only half the benefit of Cure Wounds or Heal spells. Additionally, Neutralize and Remove spells grant you a save to throw off whichever effect they are targeting, but aren't automatic.

History						KEY:Disadvantage ~ History						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESC:The player has a few pages of notes for the GM about the character's history, personality, and goals.

Insane						KEY:Disadvantage ~ Insane						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESC:You're out of your mind. This is usually limited to particular situations or subjects, leaving you sane enough most of the time, but when that trigger comes up you become completely irrational.

MULT:YES	CHOOSE:USERINPUT|TITLE="Insanity"																			COST:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.19
Irreverent						KEY:Disadvantage ~ Irreverent						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESC:You are fundamentally unable to accept the "divinity" of gods. You recognize their might and may even see one as a patron, but worphip just isn't part of your nature' they're just really powerful people to you.

Outcast						KEY:Disadvantage ~ Outcast						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESC:You are socially unacceptable in a large area or with a large and important group. You might be noted as an oathbreaker, an "untouchable," a kinslayer, or an ex-slave, belong to a despised ethnic group, believe in a heretical faith, or simply have numerous obnoxious habits. In any case, a sizable segment of the people in the campaign setting will have nothing to do with you.																						MULT:YES	CHOOSE:USERINPUT|TITLE="Outcast"																			COST:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.19
Poor Reputation					KEY:Disadvantage ~ Poor Reputation					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESC:You're widely and unfavorably known. This results in a -6 penalty on "friendly" social skill and Charisma rolls throughout a major portion of the setting. This may be combined with "Outcast" in which case there's not much use in trying to talk to anybody. Even your companions will suffer penalties if it becomes known that they associate with you.

Recorder						KEY:Disadvantage ~ Recorder						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESC:The player keeps records, and ensures that the GM gets a copy.

Showman						KEY:Disadvantage ~ Showman						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESC:You compulsively posture, show off, gloat, and brag - giving away your plans and wasting time eve n in combat.

Uncivilized						KEY:Disadvantage ~ Uncivilized					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESC:You do not fit into anything beyond a small tribe.

You start off with little or no access to advanced equipment or techniques for the setting, and often take a -4 penalty when dealing with civilized societies or technologies.

Unluck						KEY:Disadvantage ~ Unluck						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESC:Your life just keeps going wrong.

COST:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.20
Untrustworthy					KEY:Disadvantage ~ Untrustworthy					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESC:You're hopelessly shifty, have an odd aura, or just give the impression that you're guilty or up to something all the time.

Valuable						KEY:Disadvantage ~ Valuable						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESC:You are worth a lot of money.
