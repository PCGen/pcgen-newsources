# The Spirit Template Abilities:
Equipage		KEY:Equipage ~ Spirit Template	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.58	DESC:Spirits are equipped with whatever mundane equipment they desire on the ethereal plane, but this will vanish with them if they're destroyed. They can be equipped with magical equipment if it is somehow moved to the ethereal plane. Creatures which do not normally use equipment do not use this power.
Manifestation	KEY:Manifestation ~ Spirit Template	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.58	DESC:As ethereal creatures, spirits cannot affect or be affected by anything in the material world. When they manifest they partly enter the Material Plane and become visible but incorporeal there. A manifested spirit can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, or spells, with a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source. They can pass through solid objects at will. A manifested spirit always moves silently and can strike with a ghost touch weapon or its Telekinesis. A manifested spirit remains partially on the Ethereal Plane, where is corporeal, and can be attacked by opponents on either plane. Spirits can freely vary the details of their manifestations appearance. When a spellcasting spirit is not manifested its spells cannot affect targets on the Material Plane, but work normally against ethereal targets. When a spellcasting spirit manifests, its spells continue to affect ethereal targets and can affect targets on the Material Plane normally unless the spells rely on touch. A manifested spirit's touch spells don't work on nonethereal targets.
Suggestion		KEY:Suggestion ~ Spirit Template	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.58	DESC:Once per round, a spirit can attempt to Suggest (as per a Suggestion spell, caster level 8 or the spirit's hit die, whichever is higher) a thought or action to a creature on the Material Plane. The target can resist with a successful Will save (DC 15 + the spirit's Cha modifier). A creature that successfully saves is immune to that spirit's Suggestions for 24 hours. Uniquely, a spirit may use this power on the material plane while remaining on the ethereal plane.
Telekinesis		KEY:Telekinesis ~ Spirit Template	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.58	DESC:A spirit can move things about within a range of 15 feet with an effective strength of 4. This can be used to inflict 1d4 points of nonlethal damage by poking a living creature's insides; this is treated as a touch attack which bypasses armor and natural armor. A spirit can also use this to attack with weapons and such, but this is rarely very effective.
Spirit Base DC	KEY:Spirit Base DC			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.58	DESC:The save DC against these abilities is equal to 10 + 1/2 spirit's HD + the spirit's Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted. [Currently %1]|SpiritBaseDC		DEFINE:SpiritBaseDC|10+CHA+(HD/2)
Dual Planed		KEY:Dual Planed ~ Spirit Template	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.59	DESC:A spirit has two home planes, the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. It is not considered extraplanar when on either of these planes.
Rejuvenation	KEY:Rejuvenation ~ Spirit Template	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	DESC:In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a spirit through simple combat: The "destroyed" spirit will normally recover in 2d4 days. As a rule, the only way to get rid of a spirit for sure is to determine what links it to the material plane and deal with that. Spirits may be linked to areas, natural features, trees, and many other things. Determining the nature of a given spirit's link may require a good deal of research. Trap the Soul also works without killing the spirit first. Bound spirits, of course, rarely want to return once they're dispelled. Destroying them in combat, or killing whoever's bound them, will both do nicely. Spirits do not breathe, eat, or sleep. They are immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, and death effects. They are not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability or energy drain, to damage to their physical ability scores, or to any effect which requires a Fortitude save. Spirits use their Charisma modifier for concentration checks. They are not at risk of death from massive damage, but are immediately dispelled at 0 HP.
