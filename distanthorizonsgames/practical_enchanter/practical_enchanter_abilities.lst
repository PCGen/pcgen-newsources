Arcanum Minimus Feat Choice												CATEGORY:Special Ability							DEFINE:ArcanumMinimusFeatCounter|0																																																																																																																																																																																														BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Arcanum Minimus Feat Choice|ArcanumMinimusFeatCounter						BONUS:VAR|ArcanumMinimusFeatCounter|-2	BONUS:VAR|ArcanumMinimusFeatCounter|count("ABILITIES","CATEGORY=FEAT","NAME=Arcanum Minimus")*2
#
Arcanum Minimus / Ambient Magic			KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Ambient Magic			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice									DESC:Conventionally used to power cantrips and trivial talismans, ambient magical energy is freely available, but very weak. The casting time increases greatly - from free actions to actions, from actions to minutes, and from minutes to hours. Ambient magic cannot power spells that normally require more than ten minutes to cast.
Arcanum Minimus / Catalyst Materials		KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Catalyst Materials		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice									DESC:The magical forces which lie within certain materials selected by the game master (a vampire's fang, the dust from a dragon's eggshell, ogre magi blood, odd minerals and rare earths, magical woods, certain crystals, etc), may be tapped to power magic. Sadly, such materials are difficult to acquire and are only good for a limited number of castings of particular spells before their power is exhausted.
Arcanum Minimus / Powers of Chaos			KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Powers of Chaos		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice									DESC:Calling on the powers of Chaos to aid you is straightforward, but reckless. The caster must save against his or her own spell (use Will if no save is specified): On a "1", it goes drastically wrong and produces a wild magical effect rather than what you want. On a failure, or a "2" in any case, it is somewhat distorted or has strange side effects (treat as a secondary spell of up to one-half of the original spell's power level).
Arcanum Minimus / Life Energy				KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Life Energy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice									DESC:One of the most common sources of extra energy for spells, but also one of the least friendly, this technique draws out the internal strength of the caster. Spellcasters using this energy source may draw on their own life force, either saving against their own spell (Will if no save is listed) to avoid fatigue (doing this twice causes the exhausted state as usual) or expending HP (usually Spell Level/2 d6), XP (5 per spell level), or temporary attribute drain (usually 1d4) in the spellcasting. Ruthless mages may draw on the life energy of sacrifices (small animals and large plants will suffice for low-level spells; a ninth level spell might require multiple sentient beings), or on the surrounding environment. Using this option reduces soil and vegetation to lifeless ash in a radius of roughly 3 feet per level of the spell, a condition that may persist for lengthy periods. This is definitely an evil act and is unpopular with everything dependent on the land.
Arcanum Minimus / Magical Devices			KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Magical Devices		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice									DESC:The energies stored within charged, or "uses-per-day", magical items may provide power for compatible spells. Simply enough, this depletes one charge or use per spell. Certain items, such as the Rod of Wonder, are compatible with almost any spell. The GM must rule on compatibility for other items. In general, a similar effect or descriptor is compatible.
Arcanum Minimus / Powers of Darkness		KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Powers of Darkness		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice									DESC:The forces of corruption are always ready to supply quick and easy power - for a price. Black magic slowly twists and warps thosewho use it, leaving a taint that's difficult to purge away. This is represented by an accumulating Corruption score. Calling on black magic normally results in 1d4 points of corruption. When your corruption score exceeds your current Will save (plus constant bonuses) plus your stage of descent you must make a Will save (DC 13 if you've been using your magic for good purposes, 16 if you've been using it for a general tool, 21 if you've been using it for selfish or evil purposes) or descend a step into the power of evil. On a success, the mage has resisted the temptations of the powers of darkness. In either case, the corruption score resets to zero. Barring such a dramatic resolution, a character's corruption score falls by one point a week automatically, by one point a day via penance, rituals, or meditation in a holy place, and by 1d4 points whenever the character makes a great commitment to good or a major sacrifice in its pursuit.
Arcanum Minimus / Powers of Light			KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Powers of Light		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice									DESC:The powers of light are stern and demanding masters, as pure and terrible as the fires of the sun. The price of drawing upon such power is purity of purpose, mind, and spirit: being a sword to stand against the darkness. This is hell on your social life. Unfortunately, unless a character lives up to very high standards, his or her spells start fizzling as the powers that be, whatever they are, decline to help him or her out. Optionally, similar benefits can be derived from the Lords of Order, but such entities issue endless orders and directives. Few mortals care to call on them.
Arcanum Minimus / Karmic Debts			KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Karmic Debts			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice									DESC:Calling on supernatural beings to help you out has one basic flaw: they tend to want you to return the favor, and are powerful enough to enforce such a debt. While they rarely call upon low level characters, truly powerful individuals make truly useful pawns. Karmic debts are unlikely to be a problem at first, but lead to many unanticipated adventures later. As a variation, a character might be linked with some sort of minor entity, which the caster must keep happy if he or she wishes to continue using such spells. In either case, the karmic creditor sends irresistible curses if the character refuses to pay up.
Arcanum Minimus / Reduced Power			KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Reduced Power			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice									DESC:This isn't actually a power source; it's what happens when a spell is cast without building up the power to do it properly, usually due to failure to fulfill other conditions from this list. Spells suffer a -2 on the DC of saving against them and a -4 on the effective caster level per "missing" condition. Factors such as duration and range are reduced as the game master wishes. A few very high-level mages may not care ("So who cares if it only goes off at L12? It maxes out at 10!"), but lesser magi need every scrap of power they can muster.
Arcanum Minimus / Special Conditions		KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Special Conditions		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice									DESC:The spell is more restricted than usual. It may require peculiar environmental conditions (e.g., moonlight), that the caster possess special knowledge or skills (such as a target's "True Name" or an extensive knowledge of biophysics), won't affect certain targets, and so on. In general, this is a catch-all category. On the other hand, if the limitation doesn't really limit the spell, it certainly doesn't count. A Fireball which only affects enemies is improved, not restricted. In general, mages shouldn't make a habit of using many of these; special conditions should be closely tied to the character concept or an integral part of very special spells. Optionally, the game master may permit spells to gain up to a -3 level modifier from special conditions, provided that they are both extremely specific (e.g. only during the great once-a-century conjunction at the Gate of Ebon while holding the Scepter of Night) and have been built into the spell formula.

Enchantment / Artificer					KEY:Enchantment ~ Artificer				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EnchantmentFeatChoice									DESC:You may reduce the GP or XP cost of making devices of this type by 50%%. The time required does not change.
Enchantment / Artisan					KEY:Enchantment ~ Artisan				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EnchantmentFeatChoice									DESC:You may double the GP cost of creating an item to eliminate the XP cost or vice versa. Either option doubles the time required.
Enchantment / Bonded					KEY:Enchantment ~ Bonded				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EnchantmentFeatChoice									DESC:Spells from the item use the wielder's caster level and attribute modifiers if those are better than its own. This usually increases the sale price by 20%%; it does not increase the base cost for making an item.
Enchantment / Excellence				KEY:Enchantment ~ Excellence				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EnchantmentFeatChoice									DESC:Your items use your full attribute bonus to determine the DC of saving against them rather than the minimum required to cast the spell. This usually increases the sale price by 10%%, it does not increase the base cost for making an item.
Enchantment / Fabrication				KEY:Enchantment ~ Fabrication				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EnchantmentFeatChoice									DESC:You may increase the divisor used to determine how long it takes to make items by +2000 GP. This option may be taken repeatedly.
Enchantment / Living Magic				KEY:Enchantment ~ Living Magic			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EnchantmentFeatChoice									DESC:You may enchant living or undead creatures, including your own flesh and blood. This can also embed magic in words, ideas, songs, computer programs, and other intangible "items". Use-activated spells embedded in creatures are usually used by them at will or activate when triggered. Words are spoken, songs sung, and ideas concentrated on. You may transfer intangible items to other characters. The original character may still know the song, word, or idea, but it will no longer possess any power.
Enchantment / Multiple					KEY:Enchantment ~ Multiple				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EnchantmentFeatChoice									DESC:You may place multiple spell formulas in the same item, although all must use the same caster level. The cost is based on the highest level spell used plus 75%% of the value of the next highest level spell plus 50%% of the value of any other spells used. You may reduce the cost of a particular spell by increasing the number of charges it costs to use (2 for half cost, 3 for one third, etc, up to a limit of 5 for one fifth).

Harvest of Artifice / Alchemic Mastery		KEY:Harvest of Artifice ~ Alchemic Mastery	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HarvestOfArtificeFeatChoice								DESC:You may distill the XP you harvest into alchemical compounds. These function as universal power components, storing those XP for later use by anyone. Unfortunately, this is only 50%% efficient.
Harvest of Artifice / Gleaning			KEY:Harvest of Artifice ~ Gleaning			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HarvestOfArtificeFeatChoice								DESC:You may gather an extra 50 XP per month. This option may be taken repeatedly.
Harvest of Artifice / Philosopher's Stone		KEY:Harvest of Artifice ~ Philosopher's Stone	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HarvestOfArtificeFeatChoice								DESC:This application requires both Alchemic Mastery and Transmutation. It allows both effects to be stored in an alchemical talisman, to be used at the option of the possessor. In the case of Transmutation, the holder of the item can use it to transmute materials even without possessing this feat.
Harvest of Artifice / Transmutation			KEY:Harvest of Artifice ~ Transmutation		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HarvestOfArtificeFeatChoice								DESC:You may infuse XP into material to transmute it into more useful forms. This costs 1 XP per 2 GP worth of equipment so produced.

Imbuement / Excellence					KEY:Imbuement ~ Excellence				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ImbuementFeatChoice									DESC:Your items use your full attribute bonus to determine the DC of saving against them rather than the minimum required to cast the spell. This increases the sale price by 10%% when it makes a difference, it does not increase the base cost for making an item.
Imbuement / Fabrication					KEY:Imbuement ~ Fabrication				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ImbuementFeatChoice									DESC:You may increase the divisor used to determine how long it takes to make items by +2000 GP. This option may be taken repeatedly.
Imbuement / Living Magic				KEY:Imbuement ~ Living Magic				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ImbuementFeatChoice									DESC:You may enchant living or undead creatures, including your own flesh and blood.

Scribing / Bonded						KEY:Scribing ~ Bonded					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ScribingFeatChoice										DESC:Spells from the item use the wielder's caster level and attribute modifiers if those are better than its own. This usually increases the sale price by 20%%, it does not increase the base cost for making an item. Optionally, you may set the base caster level of a bonded item of this type to one, regardless of the level of the spell, but if you take this option, the user must supply the power required to use the spell in the form of an appropriate unused spell slot. Obviously enough, such items are only useful to spellcasters using the same style of magic and capable of casting spells of the same level in the first place. Excellence: Your items use your full attribute bonus to determine the DC of saving against them rather than the minimum required to cast the spell. This usually increases the sale price by 10%%, but it does not increase the base cost for making an item.
