Immerse	KEY:Calling Gift ~ Immerse		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Calling Gift.Display	DESC:Emissaries carry lots of confidential information and knowledge. He can choose a single thought, memory, or fact and bury it so deeply in his mind that no mundane methods (interrogation, hypnosis, and so forth) can detect or find it - even the Emissary has no access to it. The Emissary chooses a time or circumstance that it will reappear when he buries it. Against magical methods of sensing (such as serenades that read minds) the Emissary's MIND is considered double its normal value; the magical method must achieve a Mythic or better effect level to detect it.
Terrain	KEY:Calling Gift ~ Terrain		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Calling Gift.Display	DESC:Explorers always have an innate sense of their surroundings. If he spends at least one full day in a general previously unknown area (roughly equal to his PER in square miles) he may choose to gain a bonus equal to half his SPT. This bonus is usable against Surprise and Tactical penalties. If the character leaves the area for more than one full day, the bonus is lost. On future forays into the area he now knows where to look for such trouble spots.
The Mask	KEY:Calling Gift ~ The Mask		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Calling Gift.Display	DESC:Harlequins can use a single action to assume traits necessary to infiltrate or escape a situation - changes to eye color, hair color/length, a few inches gain/loss in height, even minor changes to basic bone structure of face and body can occur. This also works on their himsati as well. It cannot make major changes such as apparent sex or himsati species. The change is physical - it is not an illusion - and lasts for one scene; the character can change back earlier if desired.
Empathy	KEY:Calling Gift ~ Empathy		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Calling Gift.Display	DESC:Jugglers can obtain a piece of information from a target (that the target truly considers vital) by rolling their PER against a target number equal to the target's WIL. If successful, he gains information in the form of a stray thought, a mental picture, and so forth; the clarity is based on how much he beat the target number by. Whether he succeeds or fails, the target is unaware of the Juggler's attempt.
Sleepless	KEY:Calling Gift ~ Sleepless		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Calling Gift.Display	DESC:A Keeper can remain awake and completely alert for a number of weeks equal to twice his END. During this time he will need only the most minimal of nourishment as well. At the end of this time he requires 24 hours of sustained sleep, rest and nourishment. He may choose to begin the rest period early, ending the gift's use at that time.
Lore		KEY:Calling Gift ~ Lore			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Calling Gift.Display	DESC:A Mentor can make a WIL roll against a target number equal to his own SPT to recall any fact, legend, memory and so forth, possessed by himself or any of his Avatars. It takes approximately one minute to focus and recall the information in this manner. Things recalled into memory are subject to bias based on the character's mental state and if drawn from one, the perception and personality of the Avatar. Drawing knowledge from an Avatar does not require the Avatar to be cooperative or even “awake” within the character's mind - only that the character is aware of the existence of the Avatar within him.
Soulprice	KEY:Calling Gift ~ Soulprice		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Calling Gift.Display	DESC:A Merchant can determine what a target is willing to give or do in order to obtain his goods or services. Alternatively he can gauge what he might offer to obtain a good or service from the target. The Merchant makes a PER roll against a target number equal to the target's WIL. If successful, he gains that information in the form of a stray thought, a mental picture, and so forth; the clarity is based on how much he beat the target number by. Whether he succeeds or fails, the target is unaware of the Merchant's attempt.
Notice Not	KEY:Calling Gift ~ Notice Not		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Calling Gift.Display	DESC:Mystics can blend into a situation so completely that they go completely unnoticed by anyone they do not directly interact with, even afterwards people will have a difficult time remembering their interaction with the Mystic. When using this ability, anyone who may be aware of the Mystics presence must make a PER roll against a target number equal to twice the Mystic's own PRS to notice him. The gift remains active for one scene. This gift works well within places like the Morpheum, where the Mystic may not wish to interfere in a mortal's dreams.
Discernment	KEY:Calling Gift ~ Discernment	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Calling Gift.Display	DESC:A Probe has the knack for picking up on subtle clues and uncovering facts even after others have performed exhaustive searches and investigations. In game terms the Probe can take a “second chance” to uncover clues and facts that others (including himself) have missed earlier. At any point, the Probe may make a PER roll and add 2 to the roll; the Narrator compares that to any target numbers for clues or other facts that were missed during the scene. The Narrator then reveals one of the missed clues or facts to the Probe in a manner of his choosing: a piece of evidence may be accidentally uncovered that was previously missed, an NPC could phrase a statement in such a way that it stands out to the Probe as a clue, or alternatively a previously disregarded clue could be brought to the fore again, underscoring its importance.
Judge's Ear	KEY:Calling Gift ~ Judge's Ear	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Calling Gift.Display	DESC:A Scourge can detect when a target makes purposeful and knowing misrepresentations during a conversation. The character makes a PER roll against a target number equal to the target's WIL. At lower success levels only bold lies and changes to facts are detected; at higher levels the character receives mental pictures and stray thoughts revealing glimpses of the truth behind them. The Scourge must be in the physical presence of the target but not need participate directly in the conversation itself, the target must be aware of the Scourge's presence. The gift ends when the conversation ends or is interrupted for more than a minute or so.
Darkstop	KEY:Calling Gift ~ Darkstop		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Calling Gift.Display	DESC:A Slayer can resist the spill taint; while other immortals buckle and fall at the wave of dark energies, the Slayer negates the effects up to half his WIL. When a mortal being - such as a Predator - is imbued with taint, it spills forth upon its death. Similarly, if a Progeny's spirit should spill to the Blue Air, any taint in his spirit spills forth as well. This normally causes a feeling of nausea and weakness in other nearby Immortals who are not attuned to these dark energies.
Assess	KEY:Calling Gift ~ Assess		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Calling Gift.Display	DESC:A Tactician is able to assess a single individual or summarize a single situation. The Tactician rolls his PER against a target number set by the Narrator (or the SPT of an individual). The more he beats that target number by, the more information that he can gain, such as the strengths and weaknesses of the individual or how the situation currently stands.

###BLOCK: Nature Master List
360 Vision				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,360 Vision					CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You ignore all penalties imposed on you for attempting to perceive or fight opponents/things behind or flanking you. You can effectively see in all directions at once. Tribe: Arachne
Absorb				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Absorb					CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You absorb the essence of your species into your body and can hold it there for the duration of a scene. At the end of the scene, the essence will automatically flow out of your body naturally. The amount you absorb can be no greater in volume than your own body in himsati form (A fire elemental the size of a mouse cannot absorb a bonfire). At any time during the scene, you can disgorge the held material outwards with explosive force. You use this as a Throwing skill-based attack (AGL only if you do not have Throwing Weapons). The maximum range is your STR in yards and it does damage points equal to twice your SPT. This nature is common for pure elementals (fire elementals absorb fire, and so forth) only. Other himsatis absorb their species (a hawk himsati absorbs birds for example). Tribes: Not Terat
Aquatic				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Aquatic					CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You ignore all penalties caused by water or being underwater. You are also immune to deep-sea pressure up to your END x1000 fathoms. 1 fathom equals 2 yards. You may swim at your full movement rates, but this does not enable you to breathe water. Additional levels double the your swimming speed (Level 1 = Normal, Level 2 = 2x, Level 3 = 4x, Level 4 = 8x, etc.) Tribe: Protean (can withstand up to END x 2000 fathoms instead of 1000 fathoms)
Arboreal				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Arboreal					CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You move and fight through trees, power lines, scaffolding, etc. at your full movement rates by effectively swinging, fast climbing, slight hops and acrobatic tumbles as needed. Penalties still apply. Additional levels double your speed (Level 1 = Normal, Level 2 = 2x, Level 3 = 4x, Level 4 = 8x, etc.)
Armor					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Armor					CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You gain a number of points of Armor equal to half your STR. This armor is intrinsic and applies against serenades and other mystic forms of damage that do not explicitly deny the use of the nature as protection. Tribe: Peri
Balance				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Balance					CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You ignore all penalties related to balance or poor footing, including those penalties created by mystical means.
Beauty				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Beauty					CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You gain a bonus equal to half your SPT for any social interactions that attempt to awe others due to incredible looks, animal magnetism, a continuous alluring scent, etc. When in full himsati, you may instead direct your beauty at a single target, forcing the target to roll his WIL against a target number equal to your PRS plus half your SPT. Failure indicates the target cannot bring himself to attack you, and will stand in awe of your presence. If you attempt to direct the power of the nature at multiple targets, the number of targets is subtracted from your PRS for determining their target number to resist. (IE -- Attempting to affect 3 targets subtracts 3 from your PRS). The effect lasts until the end of the scene, but can last longer if the Narrator deems it appropriate. Tribes: Hemari, Tuatha
Bioluminescence			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Bioluminescence				CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You ignore darkness penalties within a number of yards equal to your END. You create a vision penalty whenever desired (by using an action) equal to half your END, against everyone in hand-tohand combat range (it cannot be applied selectively).

Blood Drain				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Blood Drain				CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You heal one box of damage for every two boxes of damage you cause an opponent. This must be done through some form of direct body contact such as skin-to-skin, biting with fangs, etc. The choice to use the nature must be made before any attack rolls are made.
Blur					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Blur						CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You create a vision penalty equal to your AGL against characters attempting to hit you from range, and half your AGL against characters in hand-to-hand combat, due to vibrating at a high rate of speed, seeming to be in two places at once, blinking in and out of sight, etc. This effect will last until the end of the scene. Tribe: Tuatha
Body Compression			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Body Compression				CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You can compress your body into a space the size of an adult human fist. The shape adjusts to allow you to squeeze under doors, through keyholes, etc. Additionally, you ignore all penalties for fighting or maneuvering in close or cramped quarters. If your size grows beyond level 0, the size of the compressed body doubles for each level (Size 1 = two adult human fists, Size 2 = four adult human fists, Size 3 = eight adult human fists)
Breath				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Breath					CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You pick a liquid or gas (such as water or methane) that you can breathe in place of normal air when desired.

Camouflage				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Camouflage					CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:When moving at combat rate or slower you can create a bonus equal to half your SPT for all stealth rolls. If you stay still the bonus is equal to your full SPT.
Charge				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Charge					CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You build up momentum and move in a short burst of speed, allowing you to add half your AGL to any damage points caused during the charge maneuver. You must effectively run into your opponent for this to work. This nature can only be used once per combat turn (10 rounds).
Cling					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Cling					CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You stick to walls, ceilings and other solid surfaces capable of holding your weight, and traverse them at full movement rates. You are able to exert your full STR and fight without penalty so long as you continuously touch a surface. Additional levels double the characters speed (Level 1 = Normal, Level 2 = 2x, Level 3 = 4x, Level 4 = 8x, etc.) Tribe: Arachne
Deafen				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Deafen					CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You create a penalty against all opponents in hand-to-hand combat range, equal to half your PRS. This is due to disorientation, loss of hearing, balance, etc. The effect lasts until the end of the scene; hearing protection if sufficient may reduce the penalty the target receives.
Discharge				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Discharge					CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You emit a substance or odor (musk, deep shadows, pollen spores, ink), creating a penalty equal to half your STR against any of the target's PER rolls that rely on the effected senses. The effects last until the character can remove the penalty (step out of the shadow, wash the ink out of his eyes, etc.) or the turn ends (when it dissipates). This affects all targets in hand-to-hand combat range; it cannot be selectively applied. You can use this nature once per turn (10 rounds).
Discorporate			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Discorporate				CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You turn into a liquid, gas or other nonsolid form as soon as the nature is activated. You flow through nearly any type of crack or tiny opening. You are able to transform mundane inanimate objects and willing living beings up to your own weight and carry and manipulate them. Conventional physical attacks will not harm you, but any weapon or item imbued with immaculum or other special energies do damage equal to the amount imbued into them. The power grants no other special capabilities such as special forms of damage, flight, invisibility, etc., other natures must be used. It remains in effect until the nature is deactivated. This nature is common to air, water, fire and shadow elementals and the Tribes listed below only. Tribes: Osiri (ghost-form), Protean (shapeless water form)
Discriminatory Smell		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Discriminatory Smell			CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:(Enhanced Sense) You gain details from scents by using your PER in the same way you do eyesight. Environmental conditions, elapsed time since scent was left, etc. cause penalties to the roll. You are able to track individuals by scent with a simple PER roll (penalties can still apply).
Echolocation			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Echolocation				CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You ignore all penalties that affect your vision so long as your hearing is not impaired. You can also communicate with other entities that have echolocation as well.
Elemental Essence			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Elemental Essence			CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You summon forth the essence of your element to attack your opponents in a radius equal to your SPT in yards. You can direct it at one opponent per action and it is resolved as a hand-to-hand unarmed attack (using your combat skills) with base damage equal to your WIL. Fire elementals will seemingly burst into flame (or even lightning possibly), winds will whip around an air elemental, water will dance and stream around water elementals and the very terrain will rise up at the command of an earth elemental. Shadow elementals call forth deep pools of deadly shadow that can coalesce into physical form. Your actual body is not transformed, but remains unharmed by the maelstrom around you. This nature is common for pure elementals and the Tribes listed below only (and only for the element listed for the Tribe). You must expend actions to direct the elements; they do not move about on their own, they have no sentience. Tribes: Peri (earth), Phoenix (fire) and Protean (water), Not Terat
Elongated Limbs			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Elongated Limbs				CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:Your reach is extended one additional yard for every level purchased. Characters with longer reach impose tactical penalties against opponents with shorter reaches in hand-to-hand combat. This power can simulate longer arms and legs, the extended crushing power of a constrictor snake's ability to coil around its target, an excessively long tail (when used with the Tail Nature) and so forth.
Enhanced Hearing			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Enhanced Hearing				CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:(Enhanced Sense) You add half your SPT to all PER rolls to hear things in the normal range of audible sounds. It does not grant high or low frequency hearing however.
Enhanced Limbs			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Enhanced Limbs				CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:Normally, whenever you shapeshift, you are granted the appropriate number of limbs. Enhanced limbs provides a bonus when grappling other opponents, enforcing on them a penalty equal to half your STR as long as you use more than one pair of limbs to grapple. The penalty is not cumulative per pair of limbs. If your himsati does not normally have more than two pairs of limbs (two legs and two arms, or two fore legs and two hind legs) then this power may be purchased multiple times, each time giving you one additional pair of limbs. The additional limbs do not grant additional STR bonus beyond the basic one-half, just allow you to hold additional items, targets, and so forth.
Enhanced Vision			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Enhanced Vision				CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:(Enhanced Sense) You add half your SPT to PER rolls to see things that can be seen in the normal range of the viewable light spectrum.

High Range Hearing		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,High Range Hearing			CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:(Enhanced Sense) You make normal PER rolls to hear sounds above or below the normal range of the sounds audible to the human ear. Note this nature is automatically in use once activated and you are then vulnerable to attacks designed to go after these hearing ranges specifically. For example, if you have high range hearing, you will be sensitive to dog whistles, especially if they are used right next to you. High and Low are bought as separate natures.
Low Range Hearing			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Low Range Hearing			CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:(Enhanced Sense) You make normal PER rolls to hear sounds above or below the normal range of the sounds audible to the human ear. Note this nature is automatically in use once activated and you are then vulnerable to attacks designed to go after these hearing ranges specifically. For example, if you have high range hearing, you will be sensitive to dog whistles, especially if they are used right next to you. High and Low are bought as separate natures.
Hyper					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Hyper					CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:The first level removes all penalties from simple ground-based obstacles while moving, the character moves fluidly around any obstacles where a quick and easy path can be found (dumpsters, cars, people, mailboxes, turned over trashcans, etc.) Additional levels double your speed.

Immunities				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Immunities					CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You choose a normally harmful mundane substance (fire, acid, salt, radiation, etc.) and are completely immune to any damage from all nonmagical forms of that substance. Against any magical form of the attack (imbued with Immaculum, created by a serenade) the Immunity acts as if you had armor, granting half your STR as armor against that particular attack. This will combine with the Armor nature. Poison cannot be chosen for immunity. You can purchase this multiple times for multiple substances.
Infrared Vision			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Infrared Vision				CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:(Enhanced Sense) You “shut off” your normal method of seeing and now see heat patterns. It negates all vision penalties for darkness, allowing you to continue to make normal PER rolls to see. Anything that is at or near the same temperature as the surrounding air and surfaces will impose a penalty however, at the Narrator's discretion. Sudden, violent changes in temperature can also temporarily blind you.
Leap					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Leap						CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:If you leap straight up, your feet reach a height of your AGL + STR. In a standing horizontal jump you leap twice that far and six times with a running horizontal jump.

You pick up on the basic magnetic fields of most creatures as well as most electronic equipment. This also negates vision penalties that impede normal vision, but strong conflicting fields can render the magnetic sense ineffective.
Mesmerize				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Mesmerize					CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You hypnotize a target by making a contested PRS vs. PRS roll, with the target taking a penalty equal to half your WIL. If you win, the target will remain hypnotized for the remainder of the scene, or until someone does something to stir the target from the hypnotic state (scream at them, shake them, etc.). During this time you may implant a suggestion that will last a number of days equal to the exact amount you won by (minimum one day). The suggestion cannot cause the target to purposely harm himself, a loved one, etc.
Mimicry				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Mimicry					CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You can recreate any sound or voice you've heard. Those perceiving must make a PER roll against a target number equal to your PRS + SPT to realize the sound or voice is a fake.
Natural Weaponry			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Natural Weaponry				CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You add half your SPT to your STR for determining damage from horns, claws, fangs, talons, etc. This can also be used to represent stingers (like those of a bee or the hooks found in a squid's tentacles), electrical shocks (like those of an eel), etc.
Phasing				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Phasing					CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:Your body melds into other objects, physically merging with them and passing through them or resting inside. Serenades cannot be played while phasing. While phased, you are invisible to all PER rolls save those granted by serenades, and you do not need to breathe. You can stay this way until the normal need to sleep, eat, etc. overtakes you, or you decide to stop phasing. This does not grant you any form of control over the object. You can only phase through objects related to your himsati (ex: earth elemental through stone, metal, etc.; a water elemental through water or ice). If you rest inside the object, you are carried within it should the object move or be moved, and you cannot sense what is happening outside the object without physically peering out. This nature is common to pure elementals and the Tribes listed only. Tribe: Peri
Poison				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Poison					CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You can deliver a poison to your target instead of damage on a successful attack. You must choose to deliver the poison before the attack roll is made. The poison creates a penalty against all the target's actions equal to half your STR, and will affect Immortals. Characters possessing this nature metabolize standard synthetic poisons and toxins (such as alcohol) at normal human rate. Tribe: Sharakai
Regrowth				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Regrowth					CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You continuously regenerate lost limbs or organs automatically while in full himsati. You gain back the lost limb or organ at a rate of your SPT * 10%% per week (ex: A 5 SPT would bring back 50%% of the limb or organ in one week). This nature will not function if you are damaged, all boxes of damage must be healed first.
Secrete				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Secrete					CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You secrete a substance that can hinder your opponents. Each version, Slippery and Sticky, is bought as a separate nature. Any substance generated this way dissipates within a day unless you take the time to reinforce it to last longer. The substance cannot be gotten rid of by a simple act of will, it is a real substance and not just an effect.
Size					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Size						CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:When you assume full himsati you automatically grow or shrink to the appropriate size as shown on the chart below. You need Growth or Shrink to alter your size from that point: Each level of Growth allows your himsati to move up one size range and each level of Shrink down one size range. All movement modifiers are made before any multipliers for movement natures/ serenades. Growth and Shrinking automatically activate when you shift to full himsati - they only work while in full himsati. Your size will not immediately change, it takes a conscious act of will (standard action) to change your size. You can choose to be any size within the levels you purchased. Growth and Shrink are purchased as separate natures.
Sleeping Lungs			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Sleeping Lungs				CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:Sleeping Lungs only has two levels. The first level allows you to go a full scene without needing to breathe in any way, even in a vacuum. The second level allows you to go indefinitely until the nature is deactivated.
Species Communication		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Species Communication			CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:While in full himsati, you are able to communicate with mortal beings of the same species as your himsati. A cobra could communicate with mortal snakes and understand them. It also allows immortals of the same species to secretly communicate in front of others not of the same species. A character can switch between normal and companion communication at any time with no action.
Spew					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Spew						CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You must already possess Discharge, Elemental Essence, Poison or Secrete to have this nature, though you do not have to activate those natures in order to use it. It allows you to shoot the other nature's substance at a range of three times your STR in yards as a Throwing skill-based attack. The normal effects of the substance apply as per the nature supplying the substance. This allows fire breathing, spitting poison or ink, breathing blasts of air, launching pollen.
Stillness				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Stillness					CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You can meld yourself to the architecture or other surroundings and become part of it, composed of the same material and showing the same signs of wear and aging. Even to enhanced senses and close inspect you will merely be an extension of what you have attached yourself to, a sculpture or statue attached to the surface of a building, etc. You do not need to breathe while attached, and can stay this way until the normal need for eat, sleep, etc. overtakes you, or you move. You are unable to take any other actions, but are still aware of your surroundings and can see in the direction you are facing. You cannot use this power to pass through an object, this would require the Phasing nature.
Swarm					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Swarm					CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You break up into a hive-like group of miniature copies of your himsati. You lose the ability to sing serenades during this but still have access to all natures. While in this form, the swarm is able to descend upon a target and attack it in this form. The target's armor is negated unless it is a complete head to toe covering (this negates the armor nature). The swarm takes damage and is affected as a single unit, and when you return to your normal state, you retain all damage taken by the swarm. The swarm also gains a bonus to all dodge attempts equal to half your SPT. If a significant part of the swarm is separated from you when you return to your normal state, you take damage equal to the percentage of the swarm lost (the lost part of the swarm immediately dies when you return to your normal state). You can remain in swarm state until the end of the scene, unless you decide to stop using the nature sooner. This nature is only common for insects, plants and listed Tribes. Tribes: Arachne, Not Terat
Swell					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Swell					CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You receive a bonus of half your END when attempting to escape a grapple or any other bonds as your body swells. You can remain like this until the end of the scene if so desired.
Synthesis				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Synthesis					CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You heal at twice the normal rate when exposed to certain conditions or substances (sunlight, dust, water, while touching your companion animal, etc.). In addition, exposure to the substance negates the need to eat or drink. This nature can be purchased more than once to allow synthesis with more than one substance. The substance must be picked when the nature is taken.
Tail					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Tail						CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:At the first level, you use your tail as a club with your full STR. If you do not already have a tail, this nature will give you one. At the second level the tail becomes prehensile and can manipulate objects almost like another hand, it allows you to fight with a weapon in your tail as if you were fighting offhand. Tail only has two levels, unless the Narrator wishes to allow additional levels to represent extra tails (such as the infamous 9-tailed fox).
Terrible Countenance		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Terrible Countenance			CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You gain a bonus equal to half your SPT for any social interactions where you attempt to intimidate someone due to feral looks, monstrous appearance, etc. When in full himsati, you may instead direct your terrible countenance at a single target, forcing the target to roll his WIL against a target number equal to your PRS. Failure indicates the target cannot bring himself to attack you, and will cower in fear (or perhaps run away if they botch their roll). If you attempt to direct the power of the nature at multiple targets, the number of targets is subtracted from your PRS for determining their target number to resist. (IE -- Attempting to affect 3 targets subtracts 3 from your PRS). The effect lasts until the end of the scene, but can last longer if the Narrator deems it appropriate.
Vibration Sense			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Himsati Nature,Vibration Sense				CATEGORY:Character	TYPE:Display.Himsati Nature	DESC:You feel vibrations that pass through any surface you are touching. The closer or stronger it is, the more you know; you can determine numbers, rough sizes, distance, etc. You make a PER roll against a target number set by the Narrator to determine exactly how much you know.


#	KEY:Secrete ~ Slipper					Slippery: You create a penalty equal to half your AGL to be used against someone trying to grapple you or trying to climb or maintain balance on a surface you have coated. The slime of slug is an example of Slippery.
#	KEY:Secrete ~ Sticky					Sticky: You create a target number equal to your STR + SPT that a target must overcome in order to break away from the secreted substance. The webbing of a spider is an example of Sticky.
