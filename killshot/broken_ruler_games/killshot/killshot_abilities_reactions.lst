#REACTION DESIGN
#All reactions use a matching format to maintain a clear rule set for applying
#reactions to your rolls. Use the conditions listed below to understand how and
#when reactions work.
#Additional Training: Certain reactions get better with training
#and include the possibility of enhancement with additional training points.
#These points can be spent at the time of original purchase or added onto the
#reaction later when it's possible or convenient.
#Base: Indicates this reaction is available to everyone in Killshot.
#Condition: The specific type of roll required to invoke the reaction.
#These conditions can be as vague as "any attack roll" or list specific rolls,
#such as "Body vs. Mind" or "any active Sense roll".
#Level: There are three levels of reaction available in Killshot: Base, Enhanced, and Expert. 
#Base reactions are available to everyone, even if the reaction is not listed with a particular character, so
#long as they meet the conditions. 
# Enhanced reactions can only be unlocked after you gain a mechanical or survival achievement,
#while Expert reactions are only available when you have
#unlocked at least one of every type of achievement. You must still spend the training points listed for
#any Enhanced or Expert reactions.
#Trained: If the reaction requires your character to spend training points, it will say so here and the
#number required will be listed in brackets next to the reaction's name.
#Weapon: If the reaction can be gained from a particular weapon, it is listed here. Some weapon
#reactions can allow for additional training points to increase its potential.
