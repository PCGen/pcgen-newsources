#Aberrant 7

Oversized Weapon (Ex): An aberrant wields a Huge greatclub without penalty.


#Abyssal Wolf 8
Paralyzing Gaze (Su): Anyone within 40 feet meeting the gaze of an abyssal wolf must make a successful Will save (DC 16) or be paralyzed for 2d4 rounds. Half-fiends and tieflings have a -2 penalty on their save. Once a successful save is made, the target is immune to the effects of that abyssal wolf's gaze attack for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Trip (Ex): An abyssal wolf that hits with a bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+9 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the abyssal wolf.
Favored Prey (Ex): An abyssal wolf has a +2 bonus on Listen, Sense Motive, and Spot checks against non-evil half fiends and tieflings.
Keen Scent (Ex): An abyssal wolf can detect prey within 60 feet by sense of smell. This range increases to 120 feet if the opponents are upwind; and decreases to 30 feet if downwind. By making a successful Wisdom check (DC 15) the abyssal wolf can determine whether a tiefling or half-fiend is present among the opponents.
Know Alignment (Su): Abyssal wolves always know the alignment of any creature they look upon. This ability can be negated or dispelled, but the abyssal wolf can activate it again as a free action on its next turn.
Skills: An abyssal wolf has a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking by scent. This bonus rises to +6 when tracking non-evil half fiends or tieflings by scent.



#Ahlinni (Cackle Bird) 9
Breath Weapon (Su): Once every three rounds as a standard action, an ahlinni can expel a pinkish gas in a 20-foot cone. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC Fortitude save or fall prone, laughing manically as if affected by a Tashaa's hideous laughter spell (caster level 4th). The effects last 1d3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution- based.
Impale (Ex): When an ahlinni charges a foe, it deals 2d8+4 points of damage on a successful strike with its bite attack.
Birdsong (Su): An ahlinni can freely communicate with any bird or bird-like creature (such as rocs, giant eagles, and giant owls), perfectly mimicking any bird song or vocalization. Communication with non-intelligent bird creatures is on an empathic level, and can only take place if the bird is within 100 feet. In this case, this ability functions as a speak with animals spell (caster level 4th). This ability is always active, but can be negated. The ahlinni can restart it as a free action on its next turn.
Fast Healing (Ex): An ahlinni heals 2 points of damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point.
Skills: *An ahlinni has a +10 racial bonus on Hide checks when in treetops. An ahlinni has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks, and can take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.

#Angel, Empyreal 10
An empyreal's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Radiant Blast (Su): Once per day, an empyreal can increase the radiance of its form and release it in a cone-shaped blast to a range of 60 feet that deals 15d6 points of damage and blinds any creature in the area (as the blindness spell) for 3d6 minutes. Affected creatures can attempt a DC 21 Reflex save to halve the damage and avoid being blinded. The save DC is Constitution- based.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will-aid, continual flame, detect evil, discern lies (DC 19), dispel magic, holy smite (DC 18), invisibility (self only), remove curse (DC 17), remove disease (DC 17), remove fear (DC 15); 2/day-blade barrier (DC 20), cure moderate wounds (DC 16), flame strike (DC 19), scorching ray (3 rays); 1/day-heal, raise dead. Caster level 13th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Spells: Empyreals can cast spells as 13th-level clerics. An empyreal has access to any two of the following domains: Air, Destruction, Good, Law, or War (plus any others from its deity). The save DCs are Wisdom-based. Typical Cleric Spells Prepared (6/6/ 6/5/4/3/2/1; save DC 13 + spell level): 0-create water, guidance, light, purify food and drink, read magic, resistance; 1st-bless (x2), bless water, command, divine favor (x2); 2nd- align weapon, bull's strength, consecrate, hold person(x2), silence; 3rd- cure serious wounds,daylight, invisibility purge, searing light (x2); 4th-dimensional anchor, divine power, inflict critical wounds, summon monster IV; 5th-greater command, mark of justice, plane shift; 6th-harm, planar ally; 7th-summon monster VII. Domain Spells (Good, War): 1st-protection from evil; 2nd- spiritual weapon; 3rd-magic vestment; 4th-holy smite; 5th-dispel evil; 6th-blade barrier; 7th-holy word.

Aura of Goodness (Su): An empyreal radiates an aura in a 30-foot radius spread around its form. Any non-evil creature in this area attempting to attack the empyreal must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be overcome with awe and unable to take any action, other than a move action that round. Evil creatures within the area must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be unable to even look at that empyreal for one day. An affected evil creature functions as if blinded (as the blindness spell) when attacking that empyreal. On a successful save, a creature is immune to the aura of goodness of that empyreal for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.	SOURCEPAGE:p.11

#Arcanoplasm 11
Acid (Ex): An arcanoplasm secretes a highly corrosive acid that dissolves only flesh. Any melee hit deals acid damage. Constrict (Ex): An arcanoplasm deals automatic slam and acid damage with a successful grapple check.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, an arcanoplasm must hit with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.
Arcane Spell Mimicry (Ex): An arcanoplasm can mimic any arcane spell of 4th level or lower that is cast within 30 feet of it. The spell takes effect on the arcanoplasm's next action, has a caster level of 7th, and does not require any components. The save against a mimicked spell has a DC of 12 + the level of the spell. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Absorb Arcane Magic (Ex): Any arcane spell cast at an arcanoplasm is automatically absorbed. This cures 1 point of damage per 3 points of damage the spell would otherwise deal (non-damaging spells cure 1 point of damage per spell level of the spell). Spells that affect an area are not absorbed, but neither do they affect an arcanoplasm. An arcanoplasm cannot absorb divine magic and is affected by it normally.
Amorphous (Ex): Arcanoplasms have no discernable front or back and are not subject to critical hits. They cannot be flanked.
Arcanesense (Su): An arcanoplasm can automatically detect the location of any arcane spellcaster within 100 feet. This functions as a detect evil spell but there is no chance the arcanoplasm is stunned and it is not blocked by stone, lead, or other material.

#12
Blindsight (Ex): An arcanoplasm's entire body is a primitive sensory organ that can ascertain prey by scent and vibration within 60 feet.
Immunities (Ex): Arcanoplasms are immune to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, polymorph, and stunning.
Skills: An arcanoplasm has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.

#Asrai 12
Spells: An asrai casts spells as a 5th-level sorcerer. The save DC against a spell cast by an asrai is 12 + spell level. The save DCs are Charisma-based. Typical Sorcerer Spells Prepared (Cast per Day 6/7/ 5; save DC 12 + spell level): 0-dancing lights, daze (x2), detect magic, flare, resistance, touch of fatigue; 1st-hypnotism, obscuring mist, reduce person, sleep; 2nd-Tashaa's hideous laughter, touch of idiocy. Spell-Like Abilities: 2/day-control water, fog cloud, obscuring mist. Caster level 5th.
Cold (Su): The touch of an asrai is supernaturally cold. All damage dealt from an asrai's natural attacks is cold damage. This ability is constant, but the asrai can suppress or resume it at will as a free action.
Water Dependent (Su): An asrai that moves more than 50 feet from her water source, can survive on land for 1 hour per 2 points of Constitution (after that, refer to the suffocation rules in the DMG). Lost Constitution points are immediately restored if she is returned to the water. If her Constitution reaches 0, she dies, her form collapsing into a puddle of water.
Skills: An asrai has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. Asrai use their Dexterity modifier (instead of Strength modifier) on Swim checks.

#Barbegazi (Ice Gnome) 14
Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day-chill metal (DC 12), icicle blast (as burning hands, but shards of ice that deal cold damage) (DC 11). Caster level 3rd. The save DCs are Charisma-based and include a +2 racial bonus.
Snow Move (Ex): Because of its oversized flat feet, a barbegazi can walk on top of deep snow and suffers no penalties when moving through snowy terrain.
Skills: Barbegazis receive a +2 racial bonus to Craft (trapmaking), Hide and Survival checks. *The Hide bonus increases to +6 in their natural environment.

#Bedlam 14
Chaos Burst (Su): Once per round as a standard action, a bedlam can release a burst of crackling gray energy in a 20-foot radius around itself. Lawful creatures caught in the area take 5d8 points of damage and are staggered for 1d6 rounds. Non-lawful and non- chaotic creatures take 3d8 points of damage, but are not staggered. A DC 18 Will save halves the damage. Chaotic-aligned creatures are immune to this effect. The save DC is Constitution based.
Chaotic Resonance (Su): A bedlam emanates an aura of pure chaos; an invisible and ever-changing ring of chaotic matter. This aura disrupts spells and magic items (except those of a chaotic nature) used within 20 feet of the b e d l a m . Spellcasters in the area must make a s u c c e s s f u l caster level check (DC 18) each time they attempt to cast a spell. If the check fails, the spell fizzles away just as if it had been cast. Any magic item used within this area must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or lose its magical properties for that round. A new save must be made each round the item remains within the area. The check DC and save DC is Constitution based. Spells with the "chaotic" descriptor that are cast within this area function as if they were empowered (as by the Empower Spell feat). Chaotically-aligned weapons (anarchic weapons) deal an extra 1d6 points of damage while in this area (i.e., an anarchic weapon deals an extra 3d6 points of chaotic damage against lawful- aligned foes). Lawful-aligned weapons are unaffected by this aura.
Detect Law (Su): A bedlam can continuously detect law as the spell (caster level 10th), though there is no chance of it becoming stunned by overwhelming lawful auras. It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.
Immunity to Chaos (Ex): The bedlam cannot be affected by any spell, spell-like ability, weapon, magic item, or supernatural effect that has the chaotic or anarchic descriptor. Creatures with the chaotic subtype are unaffected by this immunity and can attack the bedlam normally.
Immunity to Transformation (Ex): No mortal magic can affect or fix a bedlam's ever-shifting chaotic form. Effects such as polymorphing or petrification force the creature into its new shape for a moment, but it immediately returns to its mutable form as a free action at the start of its next turn.
Resistance to Law Spells (Ex): The bedlam has SR 20 against spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects with the "law" descriptor. This spell resistance also applies to spells of the Law domain.
Skills: *A bedlam's grayish coloration grants it a +8 racial bonus to Hide checks when in areas of thick fog or smoke.

# Giant Beetle Shared
Tremorsense (Ex): Giant beetles can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with the ground.

#Beetle, Giant Blister 16
Blister Spray (Ex): Once every 4 rounds as a standard action, a blister beetle can shoot a jet of inky black liquid in a 20-foot line. A creature within the area must succeed on a DC 12 Reflex save to avoid the spray. On a failed save, the target takes 1d3 points of acid damage and a -2 conditional modifier on attack rolls and ability and skill checks for the next 1 minute (10 rounds) from painful blisters and welts that quickly appear on exposed skin. A DC 10 Heal check or any cure spell heals the blisters and negates the penalties. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Skills: *Blister beetles have a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks when in their natural surroundings.
#Beetle, Giant Saw-tooth 17
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a giant saw- toothed beetle must hit an opponent up to one size larger with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold.
#Beetle, Giant Water 17
Ink Cloud (Ex): A giant water beetle can emit a cloud of jet-black ink 10 feet high by 10 feet wide by 10 feet long once per minute as a free action. The cloud provides total concealment, which the giant water beetle normally uses to escape. All vision within the cloud is obscured.
Water Dependent (Ex): Giant water beetles can survive out of the water for 1 hour per 2 points of Constitution. After that, refer to the suffocation rules in the DMG.
Watersense (Ex): Giant water beetles can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with water.
Skills: *Underwater, a giant water beetle has a +4 bonus on Hide and Spot checks. A giant water beetle has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

#Bloodsuckle 18
Blood Drain (Ex): A bloodsuckle that grapples a foe can drain blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round the hold is maintained. Once it has dealt 8 points of Constitution damage, it releases the victim so it can continue to rely on it as a food source. Bloodsuckles never kill those they have transformed into hosts (see below) unless they are extremely hungry.
Create Host (Ex): A bloodsuckle that strikes a living target with a tendril injects a special sap into the victim that disrupts the synapses in the victim's brain and transforms it into a host if it fails a DC 18 Will save. This acts as a dominate monster spell (caster level 8th) with no duration. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throw. The save DC is Constitution-based. A victim that fails its Will save becomes a host for the bloodsuckle, and returns to the plant whenever it calls. A host is normally only used by the bloodsuckle for feeding purposes, but if the plant comes under attack, it may summon its hosts to defend it. A host with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher that is commanded to act in a manner inconsistent with its alignment (such as attacking allies) is allowed another Will save (same DC) with a +4 bonus to break the effects of the bloodsuckle's control.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a bloodsuckle must hit a creature of any size with a tendril attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can drain blood.
Seed (Ex): Once per month, a bloodsuckle can generate a walnut-sized seed that it implants in a host's body. The host wanders off, and 1d4 days later, the seed breaks open, growing a new bloodsuckle inside the host. Each day a host remains implanted with this seed, it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage. At Constitution 0, the host dies and a new bloodsuckle erupts from the corpse and takes root. A remove disease spell destroys the seedling as do spells such as limited wish, wish, or miracle.
# 19
Summon Host (Ex): A bloodsuckle can generate a high- pitched whine that only its hosts can hear. A host that hears this call proceeds immediately at its highest rate of speed and in the most direct route toward the plant. So long as the bloodsuckle and its host are on the same plane of existence, the host hears and answers the call. Usually, a bloodsuckle only calls its hosts when it becomes hungry for blood-about once every three days.
Blindsight (Ex): A bloodsuckle has no visual organs but can ascertain all foes within 30 feet using sound, scent, and vibration.
Host Sense (Ex): A bloodsuckle automatically senses the location of any of its hosts to a range of 100 feet.

#Bog Creeper 19
Constrict (Ex): A bog creeper that makes a successful grapple
check against an opponent of its size or smaller using a tendril
attack deals 1d4+4 points of damage each round the hold is
maintained.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a bog creeper must hit
with a tendril attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the
grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.
Spit Acid (Ex): Three times per day, a bog creeper can spray a
cone of digestive acid to a range of 30 feet that deals 2d8 points of
acid damage to all creatures in the area (Reflex save DC 20 for
half). It cannot use this ability if it is currently holding a creature
in its mouth. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Camouflage (Ex): When at rest, a bog creeper appears as a
normal plant. It takes a successful DC 20 Spot check to notice it
before it attacks. Anyone with Survival or Knowledge (nature)
can use those skills instead of Spot to notice the plant.
Marsh Move (Ex): A bog creeper can move across marshy
terrain without incurring any movement penalties.
Marshsense (Ex): Bog creepers can automatically detect the
location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with the same
marshy ground it is.
Skills: A bog creeper has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check
to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always
choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or
endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided
it swims in a straight line.

#Brass Man 20
Spit Molten Brass (Su): Once every 1d4
rounds (and no more than five times per
day), a brass man can spit a stream of
molten brass in a 30-foot line; damage
6d6 fire, Reflex DC 15 half.
The save DC is Constitution-based.

Immunity to Magic (Ex): A brass man is immune to any
spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In
addition, certain spells and effects function differently
against the creature, as noted below.
A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows a
brass man (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving
throw.
A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow
effect on the brass man and heals 1 point of damage for each
3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the
amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full
normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit
points. A brass man gets no saving throw against fire effects.

#Burning Dervish 21
Flame Form (Su): Three times per day, as a standard
action, a burning dervish can change its form to
that of a column of fire. In this form it gains two slam
attacks and deals 1d6 points of fire damage each time
it hits or grapples an opponent. Additionally, a foe
must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or catch fire.
Creatures hitting a burning dervish in flame form
with natural weapons or unarmed attacks take fire
damage as though hit by the burning dervish's attack,
and also catch on fire unless they make a successful
Reflex save.
Spell-Like Abilities: 3/day-invisibility (self only),
pyrotechnics (DC 14); 2/day-enlarge person (DC 13)
or reduce person (DC 13) (either can be used on the
burning dervish), produce flame. Caster level 14th.
The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Elemental Endurance (Ex): Burning dervishes can
survive on the Elemental Planes of Air or Earth for
up to 48 hours and on the Elemental Plane of Water
for up to 12 hours. Failure to return to the Elemental
Plane of Fire or Plane of Molten Skies after that
time deals 1 point of damage per hour to a
burning dervish until it dies or returns
to the Elemental Plane of Fire.
Plane Shift (Sp): A
burning dervish can
enter any of the elemental
planes, the
Astral Plane, or
the Material
Plane. This
ability transports
the
burning dervish
and up to eight other
creatures, provided they all
link hands with the burning
dervish. I t i s
otherwise similar to the
spell of the same name
(caster level 13th).

#Cadaver 22
Disease (Ex): Filth fever-claw or bite, Fortitude
save DC 11, incubation period 1d3 days; damage 1d3
Dexterity and 1d3 Constitution (see Disease in the
DMG). The save DC is Charisma-based.
Reanimation (Ex): When reduced to 0 hit points or
less, a cadaver is not destroyed; rather it begins the
process of reanimating by regaining 1 hit point per
round. Hit points lost to magical weapons or spells are
not regained. When the creature reaches its full hit
point total (minus damage dealt from magical attacks
and weapons), it stands up, ready to fight again.
If the creature is destroyed by a cleric's turning
ability, it cannot reanimate. If a cleric casts gentle
repose on the cadaver when it reaches 0 hit points, it
cannot reanimate. A bless spell delays the reanimation,
causing the creature to regain hit points at half
its normal rate (i.e., 1 hit point every other round).

#Caterprism 23
Crystal Silk (Ex): Three times per day, as a standard
action, a caterprism can spew forth a crystalline
silk-like substance in a 20-foot cone. The substance
instantly solidifies to a rock-like hardness, forming
needle-sharp spears of crystal that impale those in the
area and deal 3d6 points of piercing damage. A DC 17
Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Constitution-
based.
Crystalline Mandibles (Ex): The mandibles of a
caterprism are so powerful that they can bite through
nearly anything. The bite attack of a caterprism is
treated like a touch attack; i.e., it ignores any armor
bonus.
Further, the bite of a caterprism is considered to have the
vorpal special quality, and on a successful critical hit with its
bite attack, the caterprism severs the head of its opponent.

#Cave Leech 24
Blood Drain (Su): A cave leech can suck blood from a
foe with its bite by making a successful grapple check. If it
pins the foe, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution
drain each round the pin is maintained.
Constrict (Ex): A cave leech deals 1d4+2 points of
damage with a successful grapple check. If an opponent is
being grappled when a tentacle is severed, the tentacle
continues to constrict and deals one-half damage (1d2+1).
(See tentacles, below.)
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a cave leech
must hit an opponent of any size with a tentacle attack. It
can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without
provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple
check, it establishes a hold and can constrict. A cave leech
gains a +4 bonus to its attack roll if it bites a grappled foe.
Tentacles (Ex): A single tentacle is AC 13 and has 5 hit
points. Damaging a tentacle does not harm the cave leech
itself. Severing a tentacle does not break its hold on a
creature it is grappling, but does reduce the damage by one
half (see constrict, above). A severed tentacle has a grapple
check of +2, and a severed tentacle regrows in 1d4 days.
Tremorsense (Ex): A cave leech can automatically
sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in
contact with the ground.
Skills: Cave leeches have a +8 racial bonus on Hide
checks.
A cave leech has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always
choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or
endangered. It can use the run action while swimming,
provided it swims in a straight line.

#Cerebral Stalker 25
Consume Brain (Ex): Once it has its victim underground, the
cerebral stalker begins gnawing on the victim's head, rapidly
chewing through bone and tissue, dealing 2d8+4 points of damage
each round. When the victim dies, the cerebral stalker has
reached its goal-the victim's brain, which it promptly devours.
A victim slain in this manner is ejected from ground and becomes
a zombie (see below).
Create Zombie (Su): A creature whose brain is devoured by a
cerebral stalker is ejected from the ground and animates as a
zombie in 1d4 rounds. Zombies created in this manner are not
under the control of the cerebral stalker.
Fear Gaze (Su): The eyes of a cerebral stalker instill fear in
living creatures that meet its gaze. Creatures must succeed on a DC
16 Will save or stand shaking in fear and unable to act for 1d4
rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is a mind-affecting
fear effect. On a successful save, that creature is immune to the fear
gaze of that cerebral stalker for one day.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a cerebral stalker must
hit with both claw attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple
as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it
wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can
use its web ability to cocoon its foe.
Web (Ex): Once per round, and no
more than three times per day, a
cerebral stalker can cocoon a
grappled foe by shooting sticky
webbing from its body. The
webs cover as much of the
victim as possible, excluding
the top of the
victim's head, its eyes,
and its nose. The
webs remain attached
to the
cerebral stalker's
body and stretch
from just under its
arms to its knees.
A webbed victim
is anchored to
the cerebral
stalker and cannot
move.


The webbed creature can, as a standard action, break free with a
successful DC 20 Strength check or DC 16 Escape Artist check.
The webbing has 8 hit points and a DR of 5/fire. Note the victim
is still grappled even if it breaks the webbing and must succeed at
a grapple check to get completely free of the cerebral stalker's
grasp. The check DCs are Constitution-based and the Strength
check includes a +4 racial bonus.
# 26
Earth Glide (Ex): A cerebral stalker can glide through
stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as
easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves
behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or
other signs of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area
containing a burrowing cerebral stalker flings the cerebral
stalker back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless
it succeeds on a Fortitude save (DC 15).
Sink (Su): After cocooning a foe, the cerebral stalker
begins sinking into the ground, taking the cocooned victim
with it. It takes four full rounds for the stalker and foe to
completely sink into the ground. In the first round, the
creature sinks to its knees; in the second round to its waist;
in the third round to its neck; and in the last round, both
stalker and foe are completely underground. Creatures
attempting to grab the cocooned victim and prevent the
sinking must first break or burn the webbing (see above),
and then succeed at a grapple check against the cerebral
stalker. A dispel magic (or similar effect) cast on a sinking
cerebral stalker paralyzes it (as if by a hold person spell) for a
number of rounds equal to the caster's level if the stalker
fails a Fortitude save. The stalker can make a new save each
round to negate the paralysis.
The stalker and victim sink to a depth of 10 feet where the
victim is placed in a stasis (similar to temporal stasis).
The spot where the cerebral stalker and victim sunk
radiates magic and can be detected normally. Spells such as
locate object, discern location, scrying, and other divinatory
magic reveals the entombed creature and stalker. A freedom
spell cast on the spot where the stalker and victim sunk
immediately frees the subject from the webbing and ejects
both it and the stalker, who is stunned for 1 round, to the
surface.
Tremorsense (Ex): A cerebral stalker can automatically sense the location of any creature in contact with the ground to a range of 90 feet.
#Church Grim 27
Howl (Su): The howl of a church grim causes any evil
creature within its churchyard to succeed on a DC 14 Will
save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. Good or neutral
creatures are unaffected as long as they are not there to steal
from the dead or attack the church. Whether or not the save
is successful, a creature cannot be affected by the same church
grim's howl for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Wisdom Damage (Su): The incorporeal bite of a church
grim deals 1d6 points of holy damage and 1d4 points of
Wisdom damage to a target. A successful DC 14 Fortitude
save negates the Wisdom damage. The save DC is Constitution-
based. On each successful attack, the church grim
gains 5 temporary hit points.
Know Alignment (Su): A church grim makes automatically
knows the alignment of any creature that enters its churchyard.
This ability is always active and cannot be negated.

Limited Domain (Ex): The realm of a church grim
encompasses only the churchyard; it can wander freely in its
cemetery, the churchyard, and within the church itself. It
cannot move beyond the precincts of the churchyard; it
must stop at the boundary of consecrated land.
Rejuvenation (Su): A church grim reduced to 0 or less
hit points restores itself in 24 hours, completely healed, if it
makes a successful level check (1d20 + the church grim's
HD) against DC 16. The only sure way to get rid of a church
grim is to raze the church it protects and cast unhallow on the
churchyard.
Soul Defender (Su): It is the sacred duty of a church grim
to defend the bodies and souls of those buried in its churchyard.
Any attempt to cast an animate dead or similar spell
within the confines of the church grim's domain requires
the caster to succeed on a DC 20 caster level check.
Whether the check succeeds or not, the caster incurs the
full wrath of the church grim immediately.

#Cinder Ghoul 28
Energy Drain (Su): Living creatures hit by a
cinder ghoul's slam attack gain one negative level.
The DC is 18 for the Fortitude save to remove a
negative level. The save DC is Charisma-based.
For each such negative level bestowed, a cinder
ghoul gains 5 temporary hit points.
Fire (Su): Any opponent struck by a cinder
ghoul's slam attack must succeed on a DC 18
Reflex save or catch fire (see catching on fire in
the DMG). The save DC is Charisma-based.
Smoke Inhalation (Su): As a full round action,
a cinder ghoul can attempt to force some of its
smoky form into the lungs of a living opponent by
moving into a space occupied by an opponent.
The target must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude
save or inhale part of the creature. Smoke inside
the victim's lungs burns the surrounding tissues
and organs, dealing 1 point of Constitution damage
each round for 1d4+2 rounds. The affected
creature can attempt another Fortitude save each
round to cough out the burning residue. A successful
save halts the damage. The save DC is
Charisma-based.
Smoke Form (Ex): A cinder ghoul's natural
form is similar to the gaseous form spell, though
the creature retains its natural armor bonus, all
attacks, and can use its supernatural abilities. Its
fly speed is 40 feet per round with perfect maneuverability.
A cinder ghoul is subject to the effects
of wind (in that it can be blown away, but it
cannot be dispersed and takes no damage from
wind). A cinder ghoul cannot enter water or other
liquid and cannot pass through small holes or
narrow openings.

#Clamor 29
Sonic Burst (Ex): When angered, a clamor can emit a
massive onslaught of sonic energy as a full-round action
that can be heard for miles in all directions. Any living
creature within 100 feet of the clamor must succeed on a DC
15 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d3 rounds. Further,
living creatures within 50 feet of the clamor must succeed
on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be permanently deafened. A
restoration, wish, miracle, or remove blindness/deafness spell
restores hearing and negates the stunning effect. The save
DCs are Constitution-based.
Natural Invisibility (Su): As creatures of living sound,
a clamor is naturally invisible, even when it attacks. This
ability is inherent and is not subject to the invisibility purge
spell.
Perfect Mimic (Ex): A clamor can duplicate any
sound it has ever encountered with near perfect accuracy
as a free action. Being accustomed to tone and
pitch, a bard may make a DC 20 Bardic Knowledge
check to determine that the sounds
are being produced artificially.
Another Bardic
Knowledge check (same
DC) allows the bard to realize
that the creature
making the sounds is indeed
a clamor. If the bard
has encountered a
clamor before, the
second check is not
required.
Speed of Sound (Ex): Once per day, a clamor can move
at the speed of sound for a number of minutes equal to its Hit
Dice. Its speed becomes 6,820 feet per round (1,364 squares),
but it cannot attack or make use of any of its other abilities
when moving this way.
Vulnerabilities (Ex): Any spell that creates a zone of
silence or vacuum deals 3d6 points of damage to a clamor
and forces it to make a successful Fortitude save (DC equal
to 10 + spell level + spell caster's appropriate ability score
modifier) or become panicked for 1 minute. In addition, the
following spells can affect a clamor in unusual ways.
Ghost sound, major image, minor image, message, ventriloquism,
whispering wind: These magically generated or altered
sounds force a clamor to make a Will save (DC 10 + spell
level + the caster's appropriate ability score modifier) or act
as though affected by a confusion spell for a number of rounds
equal to the caster's level.
Sculpt sound: Using this spell to warp the sound from
which the clamor is made, the caster deals 1d4 points of
damage per caster level. The clamor is allowed a Fortitude
save (DC 13 + the bard's Charisma modifier) for half
damage.
This spell also enables a bard (and only a bard) to
completely control the actions of a clamor if the
clamor fails a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level
+ the bard's Charisma modifier). If the clamor fails
the save, it is affected as if by a dominate monster
spell with a caster level equal to that of the
bard's class level.
Shout, sound burst: These spells do no
damage to a clamor, but force it to make a
Will save (DC 10 + spell level + the
caster's appropriate ability score
modifier) or be affected as if by a
charm monster spell with a caster
level equal to that of the
caster.

#Colossus, Jade 30
Breath Weapon (Su): Once every 1d4
rounds, as a standard action, a jade colossus can
spray a blast of green energy in either a 60-foot
cone or a 120-foot line. A creature in the
affected area takes 15d6 points of damage (Reflex
save DC 26 for half). A creature slain as the result of this
breath weapon transforms into jade. The save DC is
Constitution-based.
A creature turned to jade has Hardness 6, hp 40. This
effect can be reversed by casting stone to flesh, wish, or
miracle. This restores the creature's body to flesh; afterwards,
it may be raised or resurrected normally. A jade
creature that suffers 40 or more points of damage, or is subjected
to a shatter or disintegrate spell is immediately destroyed. A
destroyed creature can be restored only through the successful
casting of a miracle or wish spell.
Light Reflection (Ex): The angles that make up a jade
colossus's form allow it to reflect any light-based attacks or effects
(it cannot reflect natural sunlight however). Reflected light acts
as an emanation (lasting 1 round) that blinds all creatures (as the
blindness spell) within 40 feet for 2d4 rounds. Affected creatures
that succeed on a DC 26 Reflex save are not blinded. Undead and
similar creatures to whom sunlight is harmful to take 6d6 points
of damage (a successful DC 26 Reflex save halves the damage).
Immunity to Magic (Ex): A
jade colossus is immune to any
spell or spell-like ability that
allows spell resistance. In addition,
certain spells and
effects function differently
against the
creature, as noted
below.
A disintegrate spell slows a jade colossus (as the slow spell) for 1d6
rounds, with no saving throw.
A shatter spell deals 3d12 points of damage to a jade colossus,
with no saving throw.
A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect
on the jade colossus and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points
of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of
healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points,
it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A jade colossus receives
no saving throw against fire effects.



#Corpse Rook 32
Rend (Ex): A corpse rook that hits with two or more bite attacks latches onto the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals an extra 2d8+7 points of damage.
All-Around Vision (Ex): The three heads of a corpse rook grant it a +4 bonus to Search and Spot checks and prevent it from being flanked.

#Corpsespinner 33
Create Corpsespun (Su): Creatures slain (and not devoured)
by a corpsespinner rise in 1 hour as creatures known
as corpsespuns (see the Corpsespun template in this book).
Poison (Ex): The bite of a corpsespinner delivers a highly
toxic poison. The save DC is Constitution-based and
includes a +2 bonus from the corpsespinner's Ability Focus
feat.
Corpsespinner Poison: Injury, Fortitude DC 22 negates,
initial and secondary 2d6 points of Intelligence damage. A
victim whose Intelligence drops to 0 dies in 1 hour unless
the poison is neutralized (such as with a neutralize poison
spell). Slain creatures rise as corpsespun (see its Create
Corpsespun ability above).
Web (Ex): A corpsespinner can fire sticky strands of web
constructed of astral material to a maximum range of 80 feet
(range increment 20 feet) up to 10 times per day. This
webbing is effective against targets up to one size smaller
than the corpsespinner and is similar to a net attack. The
web anchors the target in place allowing no movement.
An entangled creature can escape with a successful DC
24 Escape Artist check or burst it with a DC 28 Strength
check. Both are standard actions. The check DCs are
Constitution-based and include a +4 bonus because the
webs are constructed of astral material. The Strength check
DC also includes a +4 racial bonus.
A corpsespinner can also create sheets of webbing that
cover a 40-foot area. Approaching creatures must make a
successful DC 20 Spot check to notice a web; otherwise they
stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful
web attack. Attempts to escape gain a +5 bonus if the
trapped victim has something to walk on or grab while
pulling free. Each 5-foot section of web has 16 hit points
and damage reduction 5/-.
Astral Jaunt (Ex): A corpsespinner can shift from the
Astral Plane to the Material Plane as a free action, and shift
back again as a move action (or during a move action). This
ability is otherwise identical with the astral projection spell,
except it only transports the corpsespinner.
Astralsense (Su): A corpsespinner can automatically
detect the location of anything within 200 feet of it on the
Astral Plane.
Skills: A corpsespinner can always take 10 on a Climb
check, even if rushed or threatened.

#Crag Man 34
Pierce (Ex): As a free action, a crag man can transform
its hands into stony points. When striking with its
hands in this manner, it deals 1d6+3 points of piercing
damage (rather than bludgeoning damage) with its slam
attack).
Piercer Hellstorm (Sp): Once per day, a crag man
can summon 2d10 piercers (see the revised entry for
piercers in the sidebar) with a 50% chance of success.
Passwall (Sp): Once per day, as a standard action, a
crag man can create an effect similar to the passwall spell
(caster level 3rd).
Stalagmite Form (Ex): A crag man's natural form is
that of a stalagmite. While in this form it does not
radiate magic and true seeing does not reveal its humanoid
form. The crag man can change forms as a free action
once per round.
Tremorsense (Ex): A crag man can automatically
detect the location of anything within 100 feet in
contact with the ground.
Skills: *Crag men receive
a +8 racial bonus to Hide
checks against a background
of stone.

#Crucifixion Spirit 35
Crucify Soul (Su): Once per round, a crucifixion spirit
can point at a single target within 60 feet and crucify its soul.
The crucifixion spirit must succeed on a ranged touch attack. If
successful, the target's soul leaves its body which collapses in a heap
on the ground. The target's soul appears as a translucent copy of
the victim and is suspended above the spot its body collapsed,
crucified in midair to a translucent, "X" shaped structure, the soul
held in place by translucent spikes or nails, driven through the
soul's wrists and feet.
The victim is not dead and is visible to all those viewing it.
Furthermore, a crucified soul cannot be attacked or affected by
anything, cannot take any actions (other than trying to escape, see
below), and experiences excruciating pain that deals 2 negative
levels to it in the round it is crucified, and one negative level each
round thereafter.
A creature slain in this manner cannot be returned to life
except through the casting of a wish, miracle, or true resurrection
spell. Even then, there is a 50% chance that such magic fails. If the
check fails, the creature cannot be restored to life by mortal magic.
A crucifixion spirit does not need to concentrate on this ability
for it to continue to affect a target. It can direct attacks against a
different opponent.
A crucified creature can attempt to escape each round by
succeeding on a DC 22 Will save. If successful, the creature's soul
is freed and returns to its body in the same round. The target is
stunned for one round, but afterwards can act normally.
The Fortitude save to remove a negative level has a DC of 22.
The save DCs are Charisma-based.
A crucifixion spirit can use this ability five times per day.
Paralysis (Su): A living creature hit by a crucifixion spirit's
incorporeal touch must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or be
paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. Remove paralysis or any other spell that
can remove a curse removes the paralysis. The effect cannot be
dispelled. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Immunity to Turning (Ex): A crucifixion
spirit cannot be
turned, rebuked,
or commanded.

#Demon, Caizel 36
Caizel's natural weapons,
as well as any weapons
she wields, are treated as
chaotic-aligned and
evil-aligned for the purpose
of overcoming
damage reduction.
Poison (Ex):
Caizel's body courses
with a virulent poison
that she can
intensify or suppress 

#37
at will. It is not secreted through her skin (therefore her touch is
not poisonous); rather it is delivered through the exchange of body
fluids with another creature (kissing, consummating an encounter,
etc.). If a target is not willing to be kissed, she must start a
grapple, which provokes an attack of opportunity. Other methods
of delivery (such as consummation of an encounter) are not
detailed here.
Caizel's poison normally deals 1d8 points of Constitution
damage if the target fails a DC 25 Fortitude save. One minute later
another Fortitude save must be made to avoid another 1d8 points
of Constitution damage.
Caizel can vary the intensity of her poison at will. This
allows her to deliver 1, 1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, or 1d8 points of
Constitution damage (as both initial and secondary damage).
Alternately, she can suppress her poison completely,
thus dealing no ability damage whatsoever.

darkness, desecrate, detect good, detect law, detect thoughts,
doom (DC 19), ethereal jaunt (self plus 50 pounds of objects

attempt to summon 1d4 chaaors (see their entry in this book) with

Touch of Ecstasy (Su): Once per round, by making a
melee touch attack against a foe, Caizel can flood the
creature's mind with the most pleasurable images it can
conjure if it fails a DC 25 Will save. This effect stuns the
creature for 1d4 rounds while its mind processes the information.
A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected
by Caizel's touch of ecstasy for one day. The save DC is
Constitution-based. Caizel can suppress this ability at will.
Skills: Caizel has a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.
Bonerazor: Bonerazor is a finely crafted and perfectly
balanced +2 dagger. Because of its expert craftsmanship it
deals 2d4 points of damage on a successful hit. Additionally,
a creature hit must make a Fortitude save (DC 25) or be held
(as by a hold person spell). The creature can make a new save
each round to escape. A creature remains held as long as
Bonerazor remains embedded in its body or until it makes a
successful Fortitude save. So long as Caizel is within 50 feet
of it, she can command the dagger to return to her hand as
a free action.

#Demon, Chaaor 37
A chaaor's natural weapons, as well as any weapons
it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-
aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.
#38
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a chaaor
must hit an opponent up to one size larger than itself
with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a
grapple as a free action without provoking an attack
of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes
a hold and can rend.
Rend (Ex): A chaaor that hits with both claw
attacks tears the flesh of its opponent. This
attack automatically deals 2d8+12 points of
damage.
Roar (Ex): Three times per day, a
chaaor can loose a powerful and
deadly roar that deals 3d6 points
of sonic damage to all creatures
within 60 feet that hear it. A
successful DC 17 Reflex
save halves the
damage.
In addition, creatures up to one size
smaller than the chaaor must succeed on a DC 17
Reflex save or be knocked prone from the force of its
roar. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Acid and Fire Spittle (Ex): Once every 1d4 rounds, a
greruor can spit a stream of acid in a 30-foot line that deals
4d4 points of acid damage. On the greruor's next turn, the
acid ignites and the opponent bursts into flames, taking
1d6 points of fire damage per round until extinguished
(see the rules for Catching Fire in the DMG). A
successful DC 21 Reflex save halves the acid damage
and prevents the creature from catching fire. The save
DC is Constitution-based.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a greruor
must hit with its tongue attack. It

#40
can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without
provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple
check, it establishes a hold and bites.

skin, a greruor has a +8 racial bonus on Escape Artist checks.

#Demon, Mallor 40
A mallor's natural weapons, as well as any weapons
it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-
aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.
Fear Gaze (Su): The infernal eyes of a mallor

that can breathe water) swimming in fouled water must
make a Constitution check (DC 10, +1 per previous check)
each round they remain in the area or begin suffocating (see
Suffocation in the DMG).
Magical liquids in the area can make a DC 27
Fortitude save to avoid fouling.
A mallor can foul up to 20 gallons of liquid a day using
this ability. Sentient- or liquid-based creatures (such as
water elementals) must succeed on a DC 27 Fortitude save

#41
or take 1d8 points of Constitution damage each hour they
remain in the area. At Constitution 0, the creature's liquid
structure fouls and it dies. The save DCs are Constitution-
based. A mallor can suppress or resume this ability at will.

takes normal damage from good-
aligned silvered weapons, and

used against her by good-aligned creatures.
Skills: Because of her ability to lie without emotion,
Demoriel gains a +8 competence bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy,
and Gather Information checks.
Reaver: Reaver is a finely crafted +3 unholy short
sword.

#Devil, Flayer 51
A flayer devil's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it
wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Flensing (Ex): A flayer devil that scores a critical hit with
a claw attack rips the flesh from its opponent's body. This
attack deals 1d3 points of Constitution drain.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will-detect good, greater teleport
(self plus 50 pounds of objects), scorching ray (3 rays); 1/day-
wall of fire, unholy aura (DC 20). Caster level 12th. The save
DCs are Charisma-based.
Summon Devils (Sp): Once per day, a flayer devil can
attempt to summon 1d4 bearded devils or barbed devils or
another flayer devil with a 35% chance of success.
Unholy Burst (Su): Three times per day, a flayer devil can
release a burst of hellish black vapor in a 30-foot radius. Those
caught within the area must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save
or be sickened for 1d6 rounds. Additionally, good-aligned
creatures suffer 3d6 points of unholy damage from the vapors
if they fail their save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Regeneration (Ex): A flayer devil takes normal damage
from good-aligned silvered weapons, and from spells or effects
with the good descriptor.

#Devil, Hellstoker 52
A hellstoker's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it
wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Bellows (Ex): A hellstoker can use its burning hands to light its
bellows as a standard action. This allows the hellstoker to fire a
jet of flame from its bellows in a line to a range of 30 feet, once per
round as a standard action. It must make a successful ranged touch
attack to hit a foe. A creature hit by the fire takes 1d8 points of
fire damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or catch
on fire (see Catching on Fire in the DMG).
Fiery Body (Ex): The oil coating a hellstoker's body is highly
flammable. As such, a hellstoker hit with a fire effect bursts into
flames. This deals no damage to the hellstoker, but does deal 1d6
points of fire damage to any creature touching or grappling the
hellstoker. The fire burns for 10 rounds (1 minute) before
extinguishing. This does not damage the hellstoker's oily hide;
therefore, it still retains its racial bonus to Escape Artist checks
(see oily hide below) and it can be caught on fire again.
Hellstokers sometimes light themselves or each other on
fire when combating foes.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will-magic circle against
good (DC 13), greater teleport (self plus 50 pounds
of objects only); 1/day-burning hands (DC
11 half). Caster level 10th. The save
DCs are Charisma-based.
A hellstoker can use its burning
hands ability to ignite itself or another
of its kind.
Summon Devils (Sp): Once per
day, a hellstoker can attempt to summon
2d8 lemures with a 50% chance
of success, or another hellstoker with
a 35% chance of success.
Oily Hide (Ex): Hellstokers do
not secrete oil naturally, but their
constant contact with it leaves them
coated with a thick layer of the
substance at all times. This grants
hellstokers a +10 racial bonus to
Escape Artist checks (included in
the statistics block). The oil cannot
be washed off or removed.
Additionally, if a hellstoker is
hit with a fire effect, it bursts into
flames. See the hellstoker's fiery
body above for details.

#Devil, Xaphan (Duke) 53
Xaphan's natural weapons, as well as any weapons he wields,
are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.
Fiery Aura (Su): As a free action, Xaphan can cause his
entire body to erupt in unholy fire (the same fires he uses to stoke
his furnaces). Creatures within 5 feet of or grappling Xaphan take
1d6 points of fire damage and 1d6 points of unholy damage each
round. There is no save against either effect, but resistance to or
immunity to fire reduces or negates the fire damage.
Fiery Gaze (Su): A creature that meets Xaphan's gaze must
succeed on a DC 36 Will save or be affected as follows:
1st-round: The victim's blood begins to boil, dealing 3d6
points of fire damage this round; the victim takes a -2 circumstance
penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, ability and
skill checks, and saves. A DC 37 Fortitude save halves the fire
damage but does not negate the penalties.
2nd-round: The victim's blood reaches searing temperatures
and begins to burn away muscle and flesh; the circumstance
penalty increases to -4. Smoke rises from the victim's flesh. The
#54
victim takes 6d6 points of fire damage this round. A DC 37
Fortitude save halves the fire damage but does not negate the
penalties.
3rd-round: The victim's blood erupts into an inferno and
explodes from its body dealing 12d6 points of fire damage; the
victim is stunned for 3 rounds. A DC 37 Fortitude save halves the
fire damage but the victim is still stunned.
A successful Will save renders a creature immune to Xaphan's
gaze for one day. The save DC against the gaze is Charisma-based
and the Fortitude saves are Constitution-based.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will-animate dead, blasphemy (DC
27), detect magic, detect good, detect thoughts (DC 22), discern
location, fireball (DC 23 half), greater dispel magic, greater teleport
(self plus 50 pounds of objects only), improved invisibility (self
only), magic circle against good (DC 23), locate creature, polymorph
(self only), produce flame (DC 22), pyrotechnics (DC 22), resurrection,
scorching ray (3 rays), suggestion (DC 23), true seeing (DC 26),
unhallow, unholy aura (DC 28), wall of fire; 1/day-limited wish,
power word kill, symbol of fear (DC 26), symbol of weakness (DC
27). Caster level 20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Spells: Duke Xaphan casts arcane spells as a 20th-level
sorcerer. His spell list is below. The saves are Charisma-based.

the banshee.
Summon Devils (Sp): Three times per day, Xaphan can
automatically summon 2 barbed devils, bone devils, or horned
devils, or 1d4 bearded devils or hellstokers, or he can attempt to
summon 1d2 pit fiends with an 80% chance of success.
Regeneration (Ex): Xaphan takes normal damage from
good-aligned silvered weapons, and from spells or effects
with the good descriptor.
Hellstorm: Hellstorm
is a Large +4 unholy
flaming burst
falchion.

#Draconid 55
Breath Weapon (Su): Each head can breathe a jet of fire once
every 1d4 rounds in a 30-foot line. A jet deals 3d6 points of fire
damage per head. A successful DC 21 Reflex save halves the
damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Poison (Ex): A draconid delivers its poison with each successful
bite attack. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Draconid Poison: Injury, Fortitude DC 21; initial and secondary
damage 1d6 Dexterity.
Web (Ex): A draconid can throw a web six times per day. This
is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50
feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against
targets up to one size category larger than the draconid. An
entangled creature can escape with a successful DC 21 Escape
Artist check or burst it with a DC 25 Strength check. Both are
standard actions. The check DCs are Constitution-based, and
the Strength check DC includes a +4 racial bonus.
Draconids often create sheets of sticky webbing 40 feet square.
They usually position these sheets to snare flying creatures but can
also try to trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must
succeed on a DC 20 Spot check to notice a web; otherwise they
stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web
attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus
if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while
pulling free. Each 5-foot section has 12 hit
points, and sheet webs have damage
reduction 5/-. Draconid webs have
fire resistance 5.
A draconid can move across its own
web at its climb speed and can pinpoint
the location of any creature touching
its web.
Skills: A draconid can always
take 10 on Climb checks, even if
rushed or threatened.

#Dragon, Dungeon 56
A dungeon dragon is
proficient in the use of all simple and martial weapons and light
and medium armor and shields.
Breath Weapon (Su): Once every 1d4 rounds, a dungeon
dragon can emit a blast of warm mist in a 100-foot line or 50-foot
cone. Creatures caught in the area must succeed on a DC 18 Will
save or be affected as if by a confusion spell for 1 minute. The save
DC is Constitution-based.
Dominate Monster (Sp): Three times per day, a dungeon
dragon can generate an effect identical to a dominate monster
spell (caster level is equal to the dragon's HD). An affected
creature can make a DC 21 Will save to resist the effects. The save
DC is Charisma-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.
A dungeon dragon uses this ability to populate its dungeon with
monsters it encounters in the surrounding terrain.
Change Shape (Su): At will, a dungeon dragon can polymorph
itself into any humanoid creature (as the polymorph spell, caster
level 15th). It never suffers disorientation as a result of this ability
and can remain in its humanoid form as long as it wishes.
Craft Crystal Ball (Su): No dungeon dragon is without its
crystal ball. The one thing dungeon dragon parents teach their
young is how to craft their own scrying crystals. Without this vital
piece of equipment, all of the dragon's labor is in vain. For the
purposes of constructing its own crystal ball, a dungeon dragon
automatically meets all the prerequisites-they are taught the
necessary skills and spells from birth. A dungeon dragon can only
innately create a basic crystal ball (see Wondrous Items in the
DMG). Those with an Intelligence score of 18 or higher often
create new crystal balls with additional powers.
Skills: Dungeon dragons have a +4 racial bonus on Listen and
Spot checks.

#Dragon, Smoke 57
Breath Weapon (Su): A smoke dragon's breath weapon
is a cone of thick, black smoke with a range of 20 feet. The
smoke cloud lasts 1d4 rounds before dispersing and can be
affected by wind. Creatures caught in the smoke must
succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save each round or spend that
round coughing and choking. A creature that chokes for 2
consecutive rounds takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage
per 2 HD of the smoke dragon. Each round a creature spends
in the smoke, the save DC increases by +1. The save DC is
Constitution-based. The smoke obscures vision and gives
concealment (20% miss chance) to creatures within it.
Smoke dragons are immune to the choking effects of their
own breath weapon as well as the breath weapon of other
smoke dragons.
Smoke Form (Ex): Once per day, a smoke dragon can
assume a smoky form as a free action. It can spend up to 1
minute per day per HD in smoke form. A smoke form dragon
can fly at a speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability). The
ability is otherwise similar to a gaseous form spell.
Skills: *Due to their coloration, smoke dragons
gain a +4 racial bonus to Hide checks in areas of
smoke or dense fog.

#Dragonship 58
Breath Weapon (Su): Three times per day, a
dragonship can belch forth a gout of fire in a 30-foot
line that deals 10d6 points of fire damage. A successful
DC 20 Reflex save halves the damage. The save
DC is Constitution-based.
Fire Vulnerability: A dragonship takes half again
as much damage (+50%) as normal from fire, regardless
of whether a save is allowed, or if the save is a
success or failure.
Navigate (Ex): A captain merely has to whisper
into the ear of the dragon-head and make a Profession
(sailor) check (DC 15) to get the dragonship to
understand its course. A dragonship never gets lost
on an ocean voyage, and has a 50% chance of auto
#59
matically being aware of any safe coastline, seaside
towns and villages, and hidden ocean dangers such as
reefs and sandbars (it only knows of such dangers if
they are in the volume of sea charts used in its
creation).
Winds (Su): At will, a dragonship can cause winds
to fill its sails. This operates as the control winds spell
(caster level 10th) with the restriction that it can
only increase the wind's force for the purposes of
propulsion. The winds are generated from a point
beyond and slightly above the dragonship's stern. A
dragonship cannot use these winds to attack; their
sole purpose is propulsion.
Skills: A dragonship has a +8 racial bonus on any
Swim check to perform some special action or avoid
a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim
check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use
the run action while swimming, provided it swims in
a straight line.

#Elusa Hound 60
Aura Tracking (Su): If an elusa hound has "tasted"
the magical aura of a living creature (a creature it has
successfully used its detect magic ability against or a
spell it has successfully detected that was cast by such
a creature), it gains a +10 competence bonus to its
Survival check when tracking that target. The aura
must be fresh ("tasted" within the last 3 hours) or the
elusa hound does not gain this bonus. This bonus
stacks with the racial bonus the hound receives for
tracking by scent (see below).
Detect Magic (Su): Elusa hounds can detect magic,
as the spell (caster level 6th). This ability is always
active and can be dispelled, but the creature can
restart it as a free action on its next turn.
Trip (Ex): An elusa hound that hits with a bite
attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+2 check
modifier) as a free action without making a touch
attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the
attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip
the elusa hound.
Skills: *Elusa hounds receive a +4 racial bonus
to Survival checks when tracking by scent.

#Encephalon Gorger 61
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, an
encephalon gorger must hit an opponent up to
one size larger than itself with a claw attack. It
can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it
wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold that
deals claw damage each round and allows it to use
its mindfeed ability.
Mindfeed (Su): An encephalon gorger can suck
brain fluid from a living creature with its fangs by
making a successful grapple check. If it pins the
foe, it drains cerebral fluid, dealing 1d4 points of
Intelligence drain each round the pin is maintained.
On each successful attack, the encephalon
gorger gains 5 temporary hit points. At Intelligence
0, a grappled foe collapses, helpless and
unconscious in a coma-like stupor.
Adrenal Surge (Ex): Twice per day, an encephalon
gorger can create an effect on itself
identical to a haste spell (caster level 10th).
Fast Healing (Ex): An encephalon gorger heals
5 points of damage each round so long as it has at
least 1 hit point.
Mindsense (Su): An encephalon gorger can
gauge the relative intelligence level of any creature
within 60 feet. This ability can be dispelled,
but the encephalon gorger can restart it as a free
action on its next turn. The creature often uses
this power to locate the most intelligent creature
in a group, whom it then targets for capture (or a
meal).
Mind Screen (Ex): The mind of an encephalon
gorger is an alien and dangerous place. Should a
creature target an encephalon gorger with a mind-
affecting effect (charms, compulsions, phantasms,
patterns, and morale effects), telepathy, or psionic
mind-affecting effect or attack, it must succeed
on a DC 20 Will save or be driven permanently
insane (as by an insanity spell, caster level 15th).
The save DC is Intelligence-based.

#Fear Guard 63
Fear Aura (Su): A fear guard can radiate
a 20-foot radius fear aura as a free
action. A creature in the area must succeed
on a DC 16 Will save or be affected
as though by a fear spell (caster level
8th). A creature that successfully saves
cannot be affected again by the same
fear guard's aura for one day. The save
DC is Charisma-based.
Spell-like Abilities: At will-ray of enfeeblement,
darkness; 2/day-deeper darkness. Caster level 8th.
Wisdom Damage (Su): The touch of a fear guard
deals 1d4 points of Wisdom damage to a living foe if
it fails a DC 16 Fortitude save. A creature reduced to
Wisdom 0 dies. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Create Spawn (Su): Any living creature reduced
to Wisdom 0 by a fear guard becomes a fear guard
under the control of its killer within 2d6 hours. If a
bless spell is cast on the corpse before this time, it
prevents the transformation.
Daylight Weakness (Ex): A fear guard exposed to
natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) suffers
2d6 points of damage and immediately flees from the
source of light. A fear guard caught in sunlight cannot
attack and can only take a single move or attack
action in a round.
See in Darkness (Su): A fear guard can see perfectly
in darkness of any kind, even that created by
deeper darkness spells.
Skills: *A fear guard has a +8 racial bonus on Hide
checks in areas of darkness.

#Fire Crab (lesser) 64
Heat (Ex): The body of a fire crab generates intense heat,
dealing 1d4 points of fire damage with its touch (1d8 points of fire damage for greater fire crabs). Creatures attacking a fire crab
unarmed or with natural weapons takes fire damage each time
their attacks hit. Any melee hit by a fire crab deals fire damage.
#65
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a fire crab must
hit an opponent up to one size smaller with a claw attack. It
can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without
provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple
check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.
Constrict (Ex): A fire crab that gets a hold of an opponent of
its size or smaller automatically deals claw and fire damage each
round it maintains the hold.
Tremorsense (Ex): Fire crabs can automatically sense
the location of anything within 60 feet that is in
contact with the ground.
Skills: A fire crab has a +4 racial bonus on Hide and
Spot checks.
A fire crab has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check
to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can
always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if
distracted or endangered. It can use the run action
while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

#Fire Crab (greater) 64


#Fire Phantom 66
Fire (Ex): A fire phantom's fists are swathed in
elemental fire. Any melee hit deals fire damage.
Creatures attacking a fire phantom unarmed or
with natural weapons takes fire damage each time
their attacks hit.
Fire Blast (Su): Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard
action, a fire phantom can hurl a small globe of elemental
fire to a range of 30 feet (no range increment). By
making a successful ranged touch attack, it deals 2d6
points of fire damage. A creature hit must succeed on a
DC 15 Reflex save or catch on fire. The save DC is
Charisma-based. (See the DMG for more information
on catching on fire.)
Immolation (Su): Normally used as a last resort,
a fire phantom can detonate itself in an
inferno of elemental fire that deals 6d6 points of
fire damage to all creatures within a 10-foot radius.
A successful DC 15 Reflex save halves the
damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.
This instantly kills the fire phantom if it fails a
DC 20 Will save. Even if the fire phantom survives,
its flames are extinguished for 1 minute.
During this time the fire phantom cannot use its
fire blast ability and does not deal fire damage
with its slam attack. It retains the fire subtype.
After 1 minute, its fires relight. If the fire phantom
survives the immolation, it may not use it
again for one day.
Rage (Ex): A fire phantom is in a constant state
of agony from the elemental fire that consumes its
body. Therefore, it is always in a berserk rage and
gains Str +4 and -2 AC (both already included in
the statistics block above). The fire phantom
cannot end this rage voluntarily and it cannot be
suppressed or negated.
Turn Immunity (Ex): A fire phantom cannot
be turned, rebuked, or commanded.

#Fire Whale (Burning Leviathan) 66
Scalding Blast (Su): As a full round action, a fire
whale can release a blast of superheated air from its
blowhole. This blast of air mixes with the cooler
(well, slightly cooler in the case of the planes of fire)
ambient air producing condensation that scalds or
burns those contacting it.
The blast from a fire whale is a cone 5 feet long per
two HD of the fire whale that deals 1d6 points of
damage per HD of the fire whale to all creatures
within the area. The resulting fallout covers a radius
equal to the length of the cone. A successful Reflex
save halves the damage.
Thus, a typical 12 HD fire whale releases a blow 30
feet long that covers a radius of 30 feet around it and
deals 12d6 points of damage. Affected creatures can
make a successful DC 22 Reflex save to halve the
damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Once a fire whale uses this ability, it must wait 1d4
rounds before using it again. After using this ability
four times, the fire whale must submerge for at least
two full rounds before it can use it again.
Blindsight (Ex): Fire whales "see" by emitting
high-frequency sounds, inaudible to most other creatures,
that allow them to locate objects and creatures
within 120 feet. A silence spell negates this and forces
the whale to rely on its vision, which is approximately
as good as a human's.
Hold Breath (Ex): A fire whale can hold its breath
for 8 x its Constitution score before it risks drowning.
Skills: A fire whale has a +8 racial bonus on any
Swim check to perform some special action or avoid
a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim
check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use
the run action while swimming, provided it swims in
a straight line.
A fire whale has a +4 racial bonus to Spot and
Listen checks. These bonuses are lost if blindsight is
negated.

#Flea, Giant 68
Attach (Ex): If a giant flea hits with a touch
attack, it uses its many legs to attach itself to the
opponent's body. An attached flea is effectively grappling
its foe. The giant flea loses its Dexterity bonus
to AC and has an AC of 13. It gains a +12 racial
bonus to grapple checks while attached (already figured
into the Base Attack/Grapple entry).
An attached flea can be struck with a weapon or
grappled itself. To remove an attached giant flea
through grappling, the opponent must achieve a pin
against the giant flea.
Blood Drain (Ex): A giant flea drains blood, dealing
1d3 points of Constitution damage in any round it
begins its turn attached to a victim. Once it has dealt
4 points of Constitution damage, it detaches and leaps
away to digest the meal. At Constitution 0 the host
dies and the giant flea detaches. If it has yet to deal 4
points of Constitution damage, it seeks a new host.
Disease (Ex): About one in twenty giant fleas is a
disease carrier. Giant fleas can transmit any non-
supernatural disease from the DMG, though most
carry filth fever. The Fortitude save against a giant
flea's disease has a DC of 11 and is Constitution-
based.
Crowd (Ex): Because of their size and tactics, up
to four giant fleas can occupy the same 5-foot space.
Leap (Ex): Giant fleas are natural jumpers and
gain a +20 competence bonus on Jump checks.
Skills: Giant fleas can use their Strength or Dexterity
modifier on Jump checks, whichever is higher.

#Fulgurate Mushroom 69


#Fungoid 69
Skills: Fungoids gain a +4 racial bonus to Listen and
Spot checks. *In swampy or forested areas, fungoids +8
racial bonus to Hide checks.

#Fyr 71
Spell-Like Abilities: 4/day-mass charm animal
(this functions as charm animal, but allows the
fyr to charm up to 4 HD of animals) (DC 12); 3/
day-warp wood (DC 13); 1/day-pass without trace
(DC 12). Caster level 9th. The save DCs are
Charisma-based.
Weapon Attunement (Su): Fyrs have a mystical
ability to attune themselves with any weapon
they wield. A weapon held by a fyr functions as a
masterwork item (gaining a +1 bonus to attack
rolls) as long as the fyr wields it. This bonus does
not stack with the enhancement bonus gained
from magical weapons, or the bonus gained from a
masterwork weapon. This bonus is included in the
statistics block above.
Speak with Animals (Su): Fyrs can speak with
animals, as the spell (caster level 9th). This ability
is always active, but can be negated. A fyr can
restart it as a free action on its next turn.
Skills: Fyr have a +4 racial bonus on Handle
Animal checks. *Fyrs receive a +8 racial bonus on
Hide checks when in their natural environment.

#Gallows Tree 71
Create Gallows Tree Zombie (Su): When a creature
dies within 15 feet of a gallows tree, it uses a sharpened
tendril to slice open the creature's abdomen, thereby
spilling the corpse's innards on the ground. The organs
#72
and fluids are then absorbed by the tree's roots. Corpses
of a size other than Medium or Large are simply left to
rot. Medium or Large corpses are filled with a greenish
pollen fired from one of the tree's branches. The abdominal
wound heals over the next 1d4 days, at which
time the slain creature rises as a gallows tree zombie
connected by a tether-vine to the gallows tree that
created it. Gallows tree zombies possess none of their
former abilities.
Gallows Tree Zombie (Ex): Each gallows tree has
several gallows tree zombies connected to it. A Huge
gallows tree may have no more than 7 gallows tree
zombies connected to it at one time. A Gargantuan
gallows tree can have a maximum of 11 zombies connected
to it at any given time. See the gallows tree
zombie entry in this book for details on that monster.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a gallows
tree must hit with its slam attack. It can then attempt
to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an
attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it
establishes a hold and deals slam damage each round
the hold is maintained.
Tremorsense (Ex): Gallows trees can automatically
sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in
contact with the same vegetation the tree is touching.

#Gallows Tree Zombie 73
Spore Cloud (Ex): As a free action, once every 1d4
rounds (but no more than three times per day), a gallows
tree zombie can breathe a cloud of poisonous, greenish
spores in a 5-foot cube directly in front of it. A creature
caught in the cloud must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save
or be slowed (as the slow spell) for 6 rounds. One minute
later, the creature must make another Fortitude save (same
DC) or take 1d3 points of Strength damage. The save DC
is Constitution-based.
Fast Healing (Ex): A gallows tree zombie heals
only if it is connected to its gallows tree by its tether-
vine.
Tether-Vine (Ex): A gallows tree zombie is connected
to the gallows tree that created it by a long,
sinewy vine. This vine can be lengthened to allow
the zombie to move up to 100 feet away from the tree.
The vine is AC 19 (touch 12) and has 10 hit points.
Harming the vine deals no damage to the gallows tree
zombie or the gallows tree, but if severed, does prevent
the zombie from using its fast healing ability.
Tremorsense (Ex): Gallows tree zombies can automatically
sense the location of anything within 60
feet that is in contact with
the same vegetation the
zombie is touching.

# Gelid Bettle Shared 74
Cold (Ex): A gelid beetle's body generates cold that deals extra
cold damage every time it succeeds on a bite attack (the exact
damage is listed in each monster's description). Creatures attacking
a gelid beetle unarmed or with natural weapons take this same
cold damage each time one of their attacks hits.
Skills: *Due to their coloration and affinity to attack from
ambush, gelid beetles have a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks in
their native environment.

#Gelid Beetle (lesser) 74
Cold (Ex): 1d4 points of cold damage.
Cold Spray (Ex): Once per day, a lesser gelid beetle can release
a spray in a 10-foot cone that deals 2d4 points of cold damage;
affected creatures that succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save take half
damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

#Gelid Beetle (greater) 75
Cold (Ex): 1d8 points of cold damage.
Cold Cloud (Ex): Once per minute, as a free action, a greater
gelid beetle can emit a cloud of icy cold vapor in a 20-foot radius.
The cloud is extremely thick and prevents ranged weapon attacks
(except for magic rays) by those in the cloud. Further, melee attack
and damage rolls take a -2 penalty. Each round, on the beetle's
turn, the cloud deals 2d6 points of cold damage to each creature
within it. A DC 20 Fortitude save halves the damage. The cloud
lasts 1d4+3 rounds before dispersing and is not affected by wind.
The save DC is Constitution-based.

#Geon 75
Animate Boulders (Sp): A geon can animate rocks within 180
feet at will, controlling up to two rocks at a time. Boulders move
at a speed of 10 feet and fight as a geon in all respects. Animated
boulders lose their ability to move if the geon that animated them
is incapacitated or moves out of range. The ability is otherwise
similar to liveoak (caster level 15th), but affects rocks rather than
trees. Animated boulders have the same vulnerability to cold that
a geon has.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will-stone shape; 1/day-move earth,
passwall, transmute rock to mud (DC 16), wall of stone (DC 16).
Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Freeze (Ex): A geon can hold itself so still it appears to be a
boulder. An observer must succeed on a DC 30 Spot check to
notice the geon is really alive.
Skills: *A geon has a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks against
a background of stone or in rocky surroundings.

#Giant, Cave 76
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the cave
giant must hit an opponent up to two sizes smaller
with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a
grapple as a free action without provoking an attack
of opportunity. If it wins the check, it establishes a
hold and can pound.
Pound (Ex): A cave giant that makes a successful
grapple check against a foe two or more sizes smaller
than itself can smash the opponent into the ground,
walls, nearby trees, or other solid objects as a standard
action. This deals 2d6+12 points of bludgeoning
damage to the victim. In addition, the opponent
must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 24) or be
stunned for one round. A cave giant can perform this
action once per round as long as it maintains the
grapple. The save DC is Strength-based.
Trample (Ex): A cave giant can trample creatures
one category size smaller than itself as a standard
action that deals 2d6+12 points of crushing damage.
Opponents who do not make attacks of opportunity
against the cave giant can attempt a Reflex save (DC
24) to halve the damage. The save DC is Strength-
based.
Oversized Weapon (Ex): A cave giant wields a
Gargantuan greatclub without penalty.
Cave Giants as Characters
Cave giant leaders are barbarians or adepts. Cave
giant clerics have access to two of the following
domains: Chaos, Earth, Trickery,
or War.

#Giant, Ferrous 77
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the ferrous
giant must hit an opponent up to two sizes
smaller with its slam attack. It can then attempt to
start a grapple as a free action without provoking an
attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it
establishes a hold and can pound.
Pound (Ex): A ferrous giant that makes a successful
grapple check against a foe two or more sizes
smaller than itself can smash the opponent into the
ground, walls, nearby trees, or other solid objects as
a standard action. This deals 2d6+22 points of blud
#78
geoning damage to the victim. In addition, the opponent
must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 37)
or be stunned for one round. A ferrous giant can
perform this action once per round as long as it
maintains the grapple. The save DC is Strength-
based.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will-heat metal (DC 14),
levitate (iron or steel objects or creatures only, including
itself); 1/day-wall of iron (DC 18). Caster
level 15th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Trample (Ex): A ferrous giant can trample creatures
one category size smaller than itself as a standard
action dealing 2d6+22 points of crushing damage.
Opponents who do not make attacks of opportunity
against the ferrous giant can attempt a Reflex save
(DC 37) to halve the damage. The
save DC is Strength-based.
Ferrous Mind (Ex): Ferrous
giants are immune to mind-
influencing effects (charms,
compulsions, phantasms, patterns,
and morale effects).
Oversized Weapon (Ex): A
ferrous giant wields a Gargantuan
greatsword or greataxe
without penalty.

#Giant, Volcano 79
Breath Weapon (Su): Three times per day, a volcano
giant can exhale a cloud of warm and sulfuric
gas in a 30-foot cone. Affected creatures must make
a successful Fortitude save (DC 24) or take a -4
circumstance penalty on attack rolls, checks and
saves for 1 minute (10 rounds) due to fits of coughing
and choking. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Trample (Ex): A volcano giant can trample creatures
one category size smaller than itself as a standard
action that deals 2d6+16 points of crushing damage.
Opponents who do not make attacks of opportunity
against the volcano giant can attempt a Reflex save
(DC 29) to halve the damage. The save DC is
Strength-based.
Rock Throwing (Ex): Adult volcano giants are
accomplished rock throwers and receive a +1 racial
bonus to attack rolls when throwing rocks. A volcano
giant can hurl rocks of 60 to 80 pounds (Medium
objects). A volcano giant's thrown rocks have a
range increment of 110 feet. As a full-attack action
a volcano can reach into an open source of flowing
lava, pull out a semi-solidified blob of molten rock,
and throw it. Such a missile deals normal rock damage
plus an extra 1d6 points of fire damage per round
for 1d4+1 rounds if it hits.
Fire Subtype (Ex): A volcano giant is immune to
fire attacks. It takes half again as much (+50%)
damage as normal from cold, regardless of whether a
save is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.
Oversized Weapon (Ex): A volcano giant wields a
Gargantuan two-handed longspear without penalty.
Rock Catching (Ex): A volcano giant can catch Small,
Medium, or Large rocks (or projectiles of similar shape).
Once per round, a giant that would normally be hit by a rock
can make a Reflex save to catch it as a free action. The DC
is 15 for a Small rock, 20 for a Medium one, and 25 for a
Large one. (If the projectile has a magical bonus to attack,
the DC increases by that amount.) The giant must be ready
for and aware of the attack.
Stone Shape (Sp): Once per day, a volcano giant
can create an effect identical to a stone shape spell
(caster level 17th).
#80

#Gloom Crawler 81
Constrict (Ex): A gloom crawler deals 1d6+7 points of
damage with a successful grapple check.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a gloom crawler
must hit an opponent of any size with a tentacle attack. It
can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without
provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple
check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.
All-Around Vision (Ex): Each of the gloom crawler's
tentacles has a single small eye near the tip. This grants the
gloom crawler a +4 racial bonus to Search and Spot checks
and it cannot be flanked.
Tremorsense (Ex): A gloom crawler can automatically
detect the location of anything within 60 feet that is in
contact with the ground.
Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex): A gloom crawler is highly
susceptible to natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell), and
takes 2 points of Constitution damage each round it remains in the
area. While operating in natural sunlight, it can only take a single
move action or attack action each round.

#Golem, Furnace 82
Breath Weapon (Su): Once every 1d4 rounds, a
furnace golem can belch forth a line of fire 5 feet
wide, 5 feet high, and 50 feet long; 10d6 points of fire
damage, Reflex DC 22 for half. The save DC is
Constitution-based.
Heat (Ex): A furnace golem's entire form is extremely
hot. Any slam attack deals fire damage.
Creatures attacking a furnace golem unarmed or with
natural weapons take this same fire damage each
time one of their attacks hits.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the furnace
golem must hit an opponent at least one size category
smaller than itself with a slam attack. It can them attempt
to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an
attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it can
conduct the grapple normally or shove an opponent up to
two sizes smaller into its furnace-interior the following
round.
Furnace-Interior (Ex): A furnace golem can try to
shove a grabbed opponent up to two sizes smaller than itself
into its interior by making a successful grapple check. An
opponent thrown into the furnace golem's interior is trapped
as a metal grating closes over the opening in the same round.
A trapped creature automatically takes 2d6 points of fire
damage each round. Escaping the creature's interior requires
a successful Strength check (DC 30) to bend
the bars. Alternately a trapped creature can
escape by dealing at least
25 points of damage to
the bars (AC 22).
#83
Note, the golem's damage reduction applies to all attacks
against the bars.
A Huge furnace golem's interior can hold 2 Medium, 8
Small, or 16 Tiny or smaller creatures.
Construct Traits (Ex): Immune to mind-influencing
effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms,
patterns, and morale effects), poison, sleep, paralysis,
stunning, death effects, necromancy effects, and polymorph.
Immune to any effect that requires a Fortitude
save (unless it works on objects, or is harmless). Not
subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability
damage, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death
from massive damage; cannot be healed, raised or
resurrected, though it can be repaired.
Immunity to Magic (Ex): A furnace golem is
immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects
function differently against the creature, as
noted below.
A magical attack that bypasses its cold resistance slows
a furnace golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no
saving throw.
A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow
effect on the furnace golem and heals 1 point of damage for
each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If
the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full
normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.
Rustproof (Ex): Though constructed of iron, a furnace
golem, unlike an iron golem, is not affected by rust attacks.

#Golem, Iron Maiden 83
Animated Host (Su): Once a victim trapped within
an iron maiden has died, it reanimates as a zombie in
the next round (as if by an animate dead spell). It
cannot escape, however, and serves only to fuel the
iron maiden and provide it with skills and abilities.
While it is trapped, the zombie cannot be attacked,
damaged, turned, rebuked, or commanded, and it
doesn't suffer any damage from the bladed lid. If the
lid of the golem is somehow forced open, the zombie
has the normal abilities of a Medium zombie (as
detailed in the MM). The victim of an iron maiden
golem must be alive when it is placed inside and the
lid is closed or the golem's animate host ability fails.
Bladed Lid (Ex): A living creature inside an iron
maiden when the lid is closed is pierced by twenty
dagger-like blades, dealing a total of 50 points of
#84
piercing damage each round. The lid automatically
seals with an arcane lock spell with a caster level
equal to that of the iron maiden golem's creator
(14th level usually). The lid can be forced open with
a successful Strength check (DC 34) or by casting
dispel magic. The knock spell has no effect on the lid.
The check DC is Strength-based and includes a +10
bonus from the arcane lock spell.
Because of the shape of the iron maiden, only a
Medium humanoid can be sealed inside.
Steal Essence (Su): An iron maiden golem that
has created a host using its animate host ability (see
above) gains 10
temporary hit
points, uses its
own base attack
bonus or the host's
(whichever i s
higher), and can make
normal use of the victim's
skills, feats, and non-magical
class abilities.
The golem must substitute
its own ability scores when
determining its total skill bonuses;
therefore it cannot
use skills requiring Constitution
or Intelligence, and
since it cannot speak,
many Charisma skills
are severely limited.
Likewise, the iron
maiden golem must
meet the requirements
for any feat
in order to make
use of that feat
(thus feats such
as Dodge and
Combat Expertise
are unavailable to
the golem). An iron maiden cannot use any
divine spells or divinely granted special abilities,
since the host within is no longer able to
receive such abilities from her deity. An iron
maiden likewise cannot use any arcane spells as
its inherent magic immunity disrupts any attempt
to do so.
Construct Traits (Ex): Immune to mind-
influencing effects (charms, compulsions,
phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), poison,
sleep, paralysis, stunning, death effects,
necromancy effects, and polymorph. Immune to
any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless it
works on objects, or is harmless). Not subject to
critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, energy
drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death from massive
damage; cannot be healed, raised or resurrected,
though it can be repaired.
Immunity to Magic (Ex): An iron maiden golem is
immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects
function differently against the creature, as
noted below.
A magical attack that deals electricity damage
slows an iron maiden golem (as the slow
spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving
throw.
A magical attack that deals fire
damage breaks any slow effect on
the iron maiden golem and heals
1 point of damage for each 3
points of damage the attack
would otherwise deal. If
the amount of healing
would cause the golem
to exceed its full normal
hit points, it gains
any excess as temporary
hit points.
Rust Vulnerability
(Ex): An iron maiden
golem is affected normally
by rust attacks,
such as that of a rust monster
or a rusting grasp spell.

#Golem, Magnesium 85
Aura of Sickness (Su): As a free action,
a magnesium golem can generate
an aura in a 10-foot radius spread
that sickens all living creatures entering
the area for 1d4 minutes if that
creature fails a Fortitude save (DC 15). A
creature that successfully saves cannot be affected
again by the same magnesium golem's aura of sickness
for one day. A delay poison or neutralize poison
spell removes the effect from a sickened creature.
Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected
and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal
bonus on their saves. The save DC i s
Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
Dexterity Damage (Su): A magnesium golem's
slam attack deals 1d4 points of Dexterity damage to
a living foe if it fails a Fortitude save (DC 13). A
creature reduced to Dexterity 0 by a magnesium
golem is paralyzed. The save DC is Constitution-
based.
Construct Traits (Ex): Immune to mind-influencing
effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms,
patterns, and morale effects), poison, sleep, paralysis,
stunning, death effects, necromancy
effects, and polymorph.
Immune to any effect that requires
a Fortitude save (unless
it works on objects, or is
harmless). Not subject to
critical hits, nonlethal damage,
ability damage, energy
drain, fatigue, exhaustion,
or death from massive
damage; cannot be
healed, raised or resurrected,
though it
can be repaired.
Immunity to
Magic (Ex): A
magnesium golem
is immune to any
spell or spell-like ability
that allows spell
resistance. In addition, certain
spells and effects
function differently
against the creature as
noted below.
A magic attack
that deals water
damage or creates
water slows a magnesium
golem (As
the slow spell) for
3 rounds, with no
saving throw.
A magical effect
that deals fire damage
breaks any
#86
slow effect and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of
damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of
healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit
points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A
magnesium golem gets no saving throw against fire effects.
Rust Vulnerability (Ex): A magnesium golem is affected
normally by rust attacks, such as that of a rust monster or a
rusting grasp spell.

#Golem, Ooze 87
Acid (Ex): An ooze golem's body secretes a deadly acid
that damages only flesh. Any melee hit deals acid damage.
Creatures attacking an ooze golem unarmed or with natural
attacks take acid damage as though hit by the ooze golem's
slam attack.
Death Throes (Ex): When an ooze golem is reduced to
0 or less hit points its body collapses into a bubbling pool of
acidic slime that covers a 10-foot square area. Creatures
touching this acidic pool take 2d6 points of acid damage (no
save) for 1d3 rounds. The acid pool remains for 10 rounds
(1 minute) before dispersing.
Amorphous (Ex): An ooze golem has no clear front or
back; therefore, it cannot be flanked.
Construct Traits (Ex): Immune to mind-influencing
effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and
morale effects), poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, death
effects, necromancy effects, and polymorph. Immune to any
effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless it works on
objects, or is harmless). Not subject to critical hits, nonlethal
damage, ability damage, energy drain, fatigue,
exhaustion, or death from massive damage; cannot be
healed, raised or resurrected, though it can be repaired.
Fast Healing (Ex): An ooze golem heals 5 points of
damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point.

#Golem, Rope 88
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a rope golem must hit
an opponent up to one size larger than itself with a slam attack. It
can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without
provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check,
it establishes a hold and can strangle its opponent.
Strangulation (Ex): A rope golem deals 1d8+3 points of
damage with a successful grapple check. Because the rope golem
seizes the opponent by the neck, a strangled foe cannot speak or
cast spells with verbal components.
Construct Traits (Ex): Immune to mind-influencing effects
(charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects),
poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, death effects, necromancy effects,
and polymorph. Immune to any effect that requires a
Fortitude save (unless it works on objects, or is harmless). Not
subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, energy
drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death from massive damage; cannot
be healed, raised or resurrected, though it can be repaired.
Fire Vulnerability (Ex): A rope golem takes half again as much
(+50%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether a save
is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.
Immunity to Magic (Ex): A rope golem is immune to any spell
or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain
spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted
below.
A disintegrate spell affects it normally. A rope trick or animate rope
spell deals 1d6 points of damage to the rope golem per three levels
of the spell caster (e.g., a 6th-level sorcerer deals 2d6 points of
damage to a rope golem if it casts rope trick or animate rope). A
mending spell heals the rope golem of 2d6 points of damage. Fire-
based effects and spells affect it as described in its fire vulnerability
above.

#Grave Risen 89
Animate Dead (Sp): Once per day, a grave risen can
animate dead, as the spell (caster level 5th).
Blood Poisoning (Ex): A creature hit by a claw attack
must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or contract
blood poisoning. This deals 1 point of Constitution
damage to the victim per minute until the victim dies or
the blood poisoning is healed. A neutralize poison or
remove disease spell rids the victim of blood poisoning, as
does a DC 15 Heal check. Multiple wounds to the same
foe do not result in multiple instances of blood poisoning.
The save DC and check DC are both Charisma-based.

#Grimstalker (Banaan) 90
Poison (Ex): Grimstalkers deliver poison with each successful
claw attack.
Grimstalker Poison: Injury, Fortitude DC 14; initial and secondary
damage 1d6 points of Dexterity damage.
A grimstalker often coats its weapons with this poison. In such
a case, the poison lasts for 1 minute or until it is touched or scores
a successful hit. The grimstalker may coat a single weapon with
poison as a standard action.
Sneak Attack (Ex): When a grimstalker flanks an opponent,
or anytime an opponent is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, it
deals an extra 3d6 points of damage with a successful attack.
Spell-Like Abilities: 3/day-control plants (DC 21), tree
shape. Caster level 8th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Skills: *Grimstalkers have a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks
while in forested terrain.
A grimstalker can always take 10 on a Climb check, even
if rushed or threatened.

#Gutslug 90
Blood Drain (Ex): A gutslug that grapples a foe drains blood.
This deals 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the grapple
is maintained. Once a gutslug has drained 8 points, it detaches and
moves away to digest its meal.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a gutslug must hit an
opponent of any size with its bite attack. It can then attempt a
grapple check as a free action without provoking an attack of
opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold
and drains blood.
Sneak Attack (Ex): When a gutslug flanks
an opponent, or anytime an opponent is denied
its Dexterity bonus to AC, the gutslug
deals an extra 2d6 points of damage with a
successful attack.
Blindsight (Ex): A gutslug has no visual
organs but can ascertain all foes within 30
feet using scent, sound, and vibration.
Vulnerabilities (Ex): Gutslugs are vulnerable
to salt. A pint of salt deals 1d4
points of damage to a gutslug each round
for 1d2 rounds. A pint of alcohol poured or
thrown on a gutslug deals no damage but
causes it to take a -4 penalty on grapple
checks for 1 minute.

#Hanged Man 91
Drag (Ex): If a hanged man hits with its rope
attack, the rope latches onto the opponent's body.
This deals no damage but drags the opponent 10 feet
closer each subsequent round (provoking no attack
of opportunity) unless that creature breaks free, which
requires a DC 18 Escape Artist check or a DC 14
Strength check. The check DCs are Strength-based,
and the Escape Artist DC includes a +4 racial bonus.
A hanged man can draw in a creature within 5 feet of
itself and attack with both claws with a +4 attack
bonus in the same round.
Rope (Su): The rope of a
hanged man is about 30 feet
long and can lash forward
20 feet or upward 10 feet
to grab a victim and
drag it closer to the
hanged man (see its
drag ability, above).
The rope has AC 22,
hardness 10, and 10 hit
points, and it has damage
reduction 5/
slashing. If the hanged
man's rope is severed
(by reducing it to 0 or
less hit points), both the
rope and the hanged man
are destroyed. Upon the
hanged man's destruction,
the rope crumbles
to dust.
Skills: *Using its
animated rope, a
hanged man has a +10
racial bonus on Climb
checks. Hanged men have a
+6 racial bonus on Use Rope
checks.


#Helix Moth (larva) 92
Acid (Ex): Helix moths constantly regurgitate
acid to aid in digestion. The bite attack of a helix
moth deals acid damage (1d6 larval) on a successful melee attack.
#93
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a
larva must hit with its bite attack. It can
then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity.
If it wins the grapple check, it
establishes a hold and deals bite and acid
damage each round the hold is maintained.
Blindsense (Ex): A larva helix moth has
no visual organs but can ascertain prey within
60 feet by scent and sound.

#Helix Moth (adult) 93
Acid (Ex): Helix moths constantly regurgitate
acid to aid in digestion. The bite attack of a helix
moth deals acid damage (1d6 larval, 1d8 adult
stage) on a successful melee attack.

Drone (Ex): The rapid beating of the helix
moth's wings creates a droning sound,
audible up to 60 feet away, that clouds the
minds of all who hear it. Affected creatures
take a -4 circumstance penalty on attack
rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill
checks for the next 1 minute if they fail a DC
21 Will save. A creature that makes a successful
Will save is unaffected by the droning
of the same helix moth for one day. The save
DC is Constitution-based.
Droning is a free action as long as the helix
moth is airborne. On the ground, it can beat
its wings as a move action with the effects as
above.
Poison (Ex): An adult helix moth delivers
a highly toxic poison with a successful sting.
The save is Constitution-based.
Adult Helix Moth Poison: Injury, Fortitude
DC 21 negates, initial and secondary damage
1d10 Strength.
Tremorsense (Ex): Adult stage hel ix
moths can automatically sense the location
of anything within 60 feet that is in contact
with the ground.

#Hoar Spirit 94
Cold (Ex): Hoar spirits generate intense cold. Any
melee hit deals cold damage. Creatures attacking the
hoar spirit unarmed or with natural weapons suffer
cold damage each time their attacks hit.
Cone of Cold (Sp): Once per day, a hoar spirit can
produce an effect similar to a cone of cold spell. The
cone is 30 feet long and deals 3d6 points of cold
damage to creatures caught within the area. A successful
DC 14 Reflex save halves the damage. The
save DC is Charisma-based.
Glaciation (Su): A creature hit by a hoar spirit's
claw must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or be
overcome with bone-numbing cold that paralyzes
the opponent for 1d4+1 rounds and deals 1 point of
Dexterity damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Sense Heat (Su): Hoar spirits can detect heat
(such as that generated by living creatures) in a 60-
foot radius. This includes the heat given off by
invisible creatures. This ability can be stopped or
started by the hoar spirit as a free action. This ability
functions as a detect evil spell (caster level 7th)
except there is no chance the
hoar spirit is stunned and it is
not blocked by stone, wood,
or other material.

#Hornet, Giant 95
Poison (Ex): A giant hornet's poison is delivered
with each successful sting. The save DC is Constitution-
based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
Giant Hornet Poison: Injury, Fortitude DC 21 negates;
initial and secondary damage 1d8 points of
Dexterity damage.
Pheromone (Ex): The first time a creature successfully
hits a giant hornet, it releases a pheromone
that heightens the aggressiveness of all giant hornets
in the area. All giant hornets within 50 feet gain a +1
morale bonus on attack rolls for the remainder of the
encounter and fight without penalty even while disabled
or dying (see the PHB).
Skills: Giant hornets have a +8 racial bonus on
Spot checks. *They also have a+4 racial bonus on
Survival checks to orient themselves.

#Huggermugger 96
Confusion Aura (Su): A group of three or more huggermuggers
can, as a free action, create an aura of confusion. Anyone within 40
feet of the huggermuggers must succeed on a Will save (DC 12, +1
per huggermugger in the group) or be affected as by a confusion spell
for 5 rounds. All huggermuggers in the group must be within 30
feet of each other to create this aura. Each huggermugger may
contribute to the confusion aura once per day. A creature that
makes a successful save cannot be affected by the confusion aura
of any huggermuggers in that group for one day. The save DC is
Charisma-based.
Natural Cunning (Ex): Huggermuggers possess innate cunning
and logical ability. This makes them immune to maze spells,
prevents them from ever becoming lost, and enables them to track
enemies. Further, they are never caught flat-footed.

#Inphidian, Cobra-Back 98
Poison (Ex): A cobra-back delivers a debilitating poison with
a successful bite from its snake-hands. The save is Constitution-
based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
Cobra-back Inphidian Poison: Injury, Fortitude DC 16 negates,
initial damage 1d4 Strength, secondary damage 1d4 Strength.
Spit Poison (Ex): A cobra-back can spit a line of poison from
its mouth to a range of 20 feet. This stream deals poison damage
as above (same Fortitude save to resist) and can be used once every
1d4 rounds.

#Inphidian, Common 99
Blinding Spray (Ex): Once every 1d4 rounds, a
common inphidian can spew forth a line of milky-
white liquid that causes blindness (as the blindness
spell) for 6 rounds to any creature struck. A Reflex
save (DC 14) negates the effects. The spray has a
range of 20 feet.
Poison (Ex): A common inphidian delivers a debilitating
poison with a successful bite from its
snake-hands. The save is Constitution-based.
Common Inphidian Poison: Injury, Fortitude DC 14
negates, initial damage 1d4 Strength, secondary damage
1d4 Strength.

#Inphidian, Dancer 100
Entrancing Dance (Su): A charmer inphidian can
sway its body in a rhythmic motion that charms all
those within 30 feet viewing the dance. The charmer
makes a Perform (dance) check. Those viewing the
dance must make a successful Will save (DC equal to
the charmer's Perform check) or be fascinated for
1d4+2 rounds. A fascinated creature can take no
actions other than defending itself. If attacked or
threatened, the fascinated creature receives a new
Will save with a +4 circumstance bonus (same DC).
A creature that makes a successful save is immune to
the entrancing dance of that charmer for one day.
Poison (Ex): A charmer delivers a debilitating poison
with a successful bite from its snake-hands. The save is
Constitution-based.
#101
Charmer Inphidian Poison: Injury, Fortitude DC 14 negates,
initial damage 1d4 Strength, secondary damage 1d4
Strength.

#Kathlin 102
Great Endurance (Ex): A kathlin gains a +4 bonus to
Constitution checks made to continue running (see run, in the
PHB). This bonus stacks with the bonus to Constitution checks
the kathlin gains from the Endurance feat.

#Lizard, Cavern 102
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the cavern
lizard must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to
start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack
of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a
hold and deals bite damage each round the hold is maintained.
Skills: A cavern lizard can always choose to
take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or
threatened.
Cavern lizards have a +4 racial bonus
on Hide and Move Silently
checks. *In areas of natural
stone or rock, the Hide
bonus increases to +8.

#Magmoid 103
Burn (Ex): The body of a magmoid is composed of
molten rock and elemental fire. Any melee hit deals
2d6 points of fire damage initially and 1d6 points of
damage for the next 1d3 rounds. Creatures attacking
a magmoid unarmed or with natural weapons take
fire damage each time one of their attacks hits just as
if the magmoid had hit with a melee attack.
Fiery Aura (Ex): Anyone within 10 feet of a
magmoid must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or
sustain 1d6 points of fire damage from the intense
heat. A new save must be made each round a creature
remains in the area. Treat this effect as an emanation
centered on the magmoid. The save DC is Constitution-
based.
Magma Blast (Ex): Once every 1d4 rounds, a
magmoid can shoot a blast of molten rock at an
opponent within 40 feet. This deals 3d6 points of fire
damage in the round it hits (Reflex save DC 17 for
half), and half that amount (3d6 / 2) for the next 1d3
rounds (no save).
Melt Weapons (Ex): Any metal weapon that strikes
a magmoid must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save
or melt away into slag. The save DC is Constitution-
based.
Blindsight (Ex): A magmoid's body is covered
with small receptacles that allow it to ascertain prey
by sound and vibration to a range of 60 feet.

#Mawler 104
Constrict (Ex): On a successful grapple check, a mawler deals
automatic bite damage each round the hold is maintained.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a mawler must hit an
opponent up to two sizes larger with its bite attack. It can then
attempt a grapple check as a free action without provoking an
attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a
hold and can constrict. A mawler being worn as an article of
clothing has a +4 racial bonus to grapple checks.
Vorpal Bite (Ex): A mawler that scores a critical hit with its
bite attack while being worn severs the extremity that was inside
it at the time. For example, a mawler being worn as a boot severs
the victim's leg. A mawler can only use its vorpal bite while being
worn.
A creature that loses a limb suffers a -4 penalty to skill checks
that require the use of two limbs. For example, a victim that loses
a hand or arm suffers a -4 penalty to Climb checks, Disable Device
checks, and so forth. Further, a creature that loses its primary
weapon-wielding arm or hand suffers a -6 penalty when wielding
a weapon in its offhand. A creature with the Two-Weapon
Fighting feat that loses its primary arm or hand
ignores the penalty for wielding a weapon in
its offhand.
If the victim loses a foot or leg, the
penalty applies to Balance checks, Jump
checks, and the like. Additionally,
the creature's speed is reduced to
one-quarter. If the severed
extremity happens to be
the head, the victim
dies immediately (unless
it can live without
its head).
Magic Aura (Su): A
mawler continuously
emits a moderate aura of
Transmutation magic. This ability
can be negated or dispelled,
but the mawler can activate it as a
free action on its next turn.
Mimic Shape (Ex): A mawler
can assume the general shape of any
object that is roughly Tiny size. A
mawler's body is fleshy and pliable, but
it can alter the rigidity of its body to resemble
metal, wood, and even stone. Most
mawlers have found that taking on the shape of
articles of clothing provides the most ready
meals. The ruse can be detected by a Spot
check opposed by the mawler's Disguise skill.
Skills: A mawler has a +8 racial bonus on
Disguise checks.

#Mimi 105
Spell-Like Abilities: At will-invisibility; 2/day-frost fingers
(as burning hands, but fires a sheet of ice that deals cold damage)
(DC 13). Caster level 8th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Once per day, a mimi can use a cone of cold (DC 17). Caster level
4th. The save DC is Charisma-based.
A group of three or more mimis together can use Otluke's
freezing sphere (DC 18), once per day. Caster level 12th. The save
DCs are Charisma-based.
Lower Temperature (Su): A mimi can, as a free action, lower
the temperature in a 10-foot radius around its body by 20-80
degrees. Creatures in the area that are not immune or resistant to
cold may take damage as detailed in the DMG (see environmental
hazards and conditions).
Skills: Mimis have a +2 racial bonus on Search, Spot, and
Listen checks.

#Murder-born 106
Charisma Damage (Su): A murder-born causes 1d4
points of Charisma drain each time it hits with its incorporeal
touch attack. On each such attack, it gains 5 temporary
hit points. At Charisma 0, a creature dies.
Despondent Wail (Su): Twice per day, as a standard
action, a murder-born can unleash a child-like wail. Any
living creature within 60 feet that hears the wail must
succeed on a DC 16 Will save or be overcome with supernatural
feelings of hopelessness. An affected creature suffers
a -10% penalty to all XP earned from this point forward
until the curse is removed. A remove curse or break enchantment
(requiring a DC 20 caster level check for either spell),
limited wish, wish, or miracle breaks the curse, but XP "lost"
while this curse is in effect are not regained. Whether or not
the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again
by the same murder-born's despondent wail for one day.
The save DC is Charisma-based.
Sense Living (Su): A murder-born can detect living
creatures within 100 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight
ability. It also senses the strength of their life force automatically,
as if it had cast deathwatch.
Unnatural Aura (Su): Both wild and domesticated
animals can sense the unnatural presence of a murder-born
at a distance of 30 feet. They will not willingly approach
nearer than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain
panicked as long as they are within that range.

#Niln (Vapor Horror) 107
Drench (Ex): The niln's touch puts out torches,
campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames
of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire as dispel
magic (caster level equals the niln's HD).
Drowning Fog (Su): Once per day, a niln can
create a muggy, vaporous cloud centered on its form.
The cloud lasts for 1 minute (10 rounds) before
dispersing, but otherwise functions as a fog cloud
spell.
The muggy vapors fill the lungs of any creature in
the area with water. A creature that takes only a
move action can hold its breath for 2 rounds per
point of Constitution; a creature that takes any action
other than a move action can hold its breath for
1 round per point of Constitution. After that, refer to
the rules for drowning (see the DMG).
Vapor Form (Ex): A niln's natural form is similar
to a gaseous form spell, except it retains is natural AC
bonus, can make attacks and use its supernatural
abilities, and has a fly speed of 60 feet (maneuverability
perfect). The niln is not subject to the effects
of wind.

#Nuckalavee 108
Augmented Critical (Ex): A nuckalavee threatens a
critical on a natural 19-20 with a hoof or bite. A successful
critical hit deals triple damage.
Breath Weapon (Su): As a free action, once every 4
rounds, a nuckalavee can breathe a cloud of noxious gas from
its equine head in a 20-foot cone that liquefies the organs of
those in the area. This cloud lasts one round before dispersing
and deals 6d6 points of damage to all creatures in the area. An
affected creature can attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save to halve
the damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
#109
Horrific Appearance (Su): Creatures viewing the grotesque
form of a nuckalavee must succeed on a DC 17
Fortitude save or take 2d6 points of Strength damage. The
damage cannot reduce a victim's Strength score below 0,
but anyone reduced to Strength 0 is helpless. Creatures that
are affected by this power or that successfully save against it
cannot be affected again by the same nuckalavee's horrific
appearance for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Nuckalavees are not affected by the horrific appearance of
other nuckalavees.
Trample (Ex): As a full-round action, a nuckalavee can
move up to twice its speed and literally run over any
opponents of Medium size or smaller. The nuckalavee
merely has to move over the opponents in its path; any
creature whose space is completely covered by the
nuckalavee's space is subject to the trample attack. If a
target's space is larger than 5 feet, it is only considered
trampled if the nuckalavee moves over all the squares it
occupies. If the nuckalavee moves over only some of a
target's space, the target can make an attack of opportunity
against the nuckalavee at a -4 penalty. A nuckalavee that
accidentally ends its movement in an illegal space returns to
the last legal position it occupied, or the closest legal
position, if there's a legal position that's closer. A nuckalavee
deals 1d6+7 points of bludgeoning damage with its trample
attack. A nuckalavee can only deal trampling damage to
each target once per round, no matter how many times its
movement takes it over a target creature. Trampled opponents
can attempt attacks of opportunity, but these take a
-4 penalty. If they do not make attacks of opportunity,
trampled opponents can attempt DC 20 Reflex saves to take
half damage. The save DC is Strength-based.

#Oakman 109
Shillelagh (Su): Any oaken club or staff wielded by an
oakman automatically gains the benefits of the shillelagh
spell (caster level 5th). This benefit is already included in
the statistics block above and only functions for an oakman.
Moss (Ex): Using its unique knowledge of plants and
herbal mixtures, an oakman can concoct unusual cakes
from tree moss. A typical oakman has 1d6 moss cakes of
random type on
#110
his person. These moss cakes have a variety of effects and
must be eaten by the target creature to take effect. Saves
(where applicable) have a DC of 15.
Ability Score Damage: The victim takes 1d6 points of damage
to a random ability score (determined when the moss cake is
created). One day after eating the moss cake, if the victim doesn't
receive a restoration spell, it must make another successful save or
one point of ability damage is actually permanent drain.
Coloration: This moss cake is quite harmless when eaten
and does nothing more than cause the victim's skin to
become spotted. The spots can be of just about any color,
though most tend to be brown, red, or blue. The spots last
for 1 hour before fading.
Healing: This moss cake heals the target as by a heal spell
(caster level 5th).
Lethargy: The victim becomes sluggish if it fails a Fortitude
save. The effects last for 30 minutes. While affected, the victim
moves at one-half its normal speed and takes a -2 circumstance
penalty to AC and on attack rolls, checks, and saves.
Pain: Eating this moss cake wracks the victim with pain
for 1d4 hours if it fails a Fortitude save. During this time, the
victim takes a -2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls,
weapon damage rolls, and ability and skill checks.
Poison: Eating this moss cake poisons the victim (ingestion,
Fortitude DC 15 negates, initial damage 1d6
Constitution, secondary damage 2d6 Constitution).
Sleep: This moss cake puts the victim to sleep for 1 hour
(as the sleep spell) if it fails a Will save.
Tree Dependent (Su): Each oakman is mystically bound
to a single enormous oak tree and must never stray more
than 1 mile from it. Any who do become ill and die within
4d6 hours. An oakman's oak does not radiate magic.
Tree Stride (Su): At will, an oakman can create an effect
identical to that of the tree stride spell (caster level 5th).
Oakmen can only travel through oak trees.
Skills: Oakmen have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks
and can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if
rushed or threatened.

#Ogren 110
Ogre Blood (Ex): Fifty percent of ogren have
enough ogre blood in their veins to qualify as ogres.
Those that qualify are considered ogres for all special
abilities and effects.
Skills: Ogrens have a +2 racial bonus on Move
Silently checks.

#Oil Shark 112
Blindsense (Ex): An oil shark can locate creatures underwater
(including under the oily seas of its elemental lair) within a 30-
foot radius. This ability works only when the oil shark is underwater
(or under oil).
Keen Scent (Ex): An oil shark can notice creatures by scent in
a 180-foot radius and detect blood in oil or water at ranges of up
to one mile.
Skills: Oil sharks have a +4 racial bonus on Listen checks.
Additionally, due to the oily secretions of their metallic scales,
oil sharks have a +10 racial bonus on Escape Artist checks.
An oil shark has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose
to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It
can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a
straight line.
*Their oily hides also allow them to glide smoothly and quickly
through normal water. In such an environment, an oil shark gains
a +10 racial bonus on Swim checks.

#Phantasm 113
Energy Drain (Su): The incorporeal
touch of a phantasm deals
one negative level. The Fortitude save
to remove a negative level has a DC of
22. The save DC is Charisma-based. For each such
negative level bestowed, the phantasm gains 5 temporary
hit points.
Possession (Su): Once per round, a phantasm can merge
its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability
is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 9th), except that
it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the
phantasm must try move into the target's space; moving
into the target's space to use this ability does not provoke
attacks of opportunity. The target can resist the attack with
a successful DC 17 Will save. A creature that successfully
saves is immune to that same phantasm's possession for one
day, and the phantasm cannot enter the target's space. If the
save fails, the phantasm vanishes into the target's body.
A phantasm automatically deals one negative level (from
its energy drain ability) each round to its host. The host can
eject the phantasm with a successful DC 17 Will save. This
save can be attempted once per round. If successful, the
phantasm is forced from the host's body and it cannot
attempt to posses the same host for 1 minute.
If turned or subjected to a dismissal spell while
possessing a host, the phantasm is ejected. The save
DCs are Charisma-based.
Aura of Desecration (Su): A phantasm has a continuous
aura of desecration that affects a 10-foot radius. This aura
can be dispelled, but the phantasm can restart it again as a
free action on its next turn. All turn attempts made within
the aura suffer a -3 profane penalty;
all undead within or entering
the aura gain a +1
profane bonus to attack
rolls, damage
rolls, and
saves (these
bonuses are
already included in the
phantasm's statistics block).
This spell otherwise functions
as a desecrate spell.
Unnatural Aura
(Su): Both wild and domesticated
animals
can sense the unnatural
presence
of a phantasm
at a distance of
30 feet. They
will not willingly
approach
nearer than
that and panic
if forced to do
s o ; they remain
panicked
as long as they
are within
that range.

#Phlogiston 114
Fire Bolt (Ex): Once every 1d4 rounds, a phlogiston
bush can release a tiny bolt of fire at a single opponent
within 40 feet (no range increment). The bolt
deals 2d6 points of fire damage to a creature struck.
The opponent can attempt a DC 14 Reflex save to
halve the damage. The save DC is Constitution-
based.
Constrict (Ex): On a successful grapple check, a
phlogiston bush deals automatic tendril damage.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a
phlogiston bush must hit with a tendril attack. It can
then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without
provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the
grapple check, the phlogiston bush establishes a hold
and can constrict.
Death Throes (Ex): If a phlogiston bush is reduced
to 0 or less hit points, it explodes in a concussive
blast of fire that deals 4d6 points of fire damage to all
creatures in a 10-foot radius. A successful DC 14
Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Constitution-
based.
Blindsight (Ex): Phlogiston bushes have no visual
organs but can ascertain all foes within 60 feet through
sound and vibrations.

#Piercer 33


#Proscriber 115
Condemn (Su): Once per day, by making a successful
melee touch attack, a proscriber can sever the
connection between a divine caster and his or her
deity. The target must succeed on a DC 22 Will save
or lose the ability to cast divine spells, turn or rebuke
undead, smite good or evil, and use any other divine-
based spell, spell-like abilities, or supernatural
abilities. On a successful save, the target takes 10d6
points of damage. The save DC is Constitution-
based.
Further, one that fails its save resists all beneficial
divine spells (such as heal, or any cure spell) cast on
him or her. A creature attempting to cast a beneficial
divine spell on a condemned creature must succeed
on a DC 20 caster level check.
The effects of this ability are permanent but can be
removed by the casting of a remove curse spell followed
by an atonement spell. The one casting the
remove curse and atonement spells must be a divine
caster who worships the same god as the condemned
and who is of a class level equal to or higher than the
condemned.
#116
Spell-Like Abilities: At will-continual flame, discern
lies (DC 19); 3/day-discern location, power word
stun; 1/day-blade barrier (DC 21), geas/quest, plane

waves of exhaustion, word of recall. Caster level 15th.

#Pudding, Blood 117
Disgorge (Ex): A blood pudding that has infused
itself can force the creature's own blood out through
its pores, eyes, ears, and mouth. This is a standard
action that deals 1d2 points of Constitution damage
each round. At Constitution 0, the host dies, and the
blood pudding exits. To onlookers it appears as if the
slain creature is bleeding profusely.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a blood
pudding must hit an opponent up to its size with a
slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as
a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.
If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a
hold and can infuse its form with its opponent. A
blood pudding gains a +4 racial bonus to grapple
checks because of the sticky slime its form secretes.
Infuse (Ex): A blood pudding that makes a successful
grapple check can merge its form with that of
a living creature. If it succeeds, the blood pudding's
form disappears as it soaks through skin, wounds, and
any other opening in the host's body. This special
attack deals no damage but allows the blood pudding
to use its disgorge special attack.
A creature infused with a blood pudding can try to
forcibly eject the creature once per round as a full-
round action (coughing it up, vomiting, and so on).
This requires a successful DC 17 Fortitude save. The
save DC is Constitution-based. A creature can be
affected by the pudding's infuse attack again, but
gains a +2 conditional bonus on its Fortitude save.
This bonus lasts for one day and is effective against
the infuse attack of that blood pudding only.
Amorphous (Ex): Blood puddings have no
discernable front or back and are not subject to
critical hits. They cannot be flanked.
Blindsight (Ex): A blood pudding's entire body is
a sensory organ that can ascertain prey by scent and
vibration within 60 feet.
Vulnerabilities (Ex): Drinking liquid with high
alcohol content weakens a blood pudding and reduces
further Constitution damage by one-half for
the next 10 minutes.
Consuming pure vinegar causes an infused blood
pudding to eject itself in the same round the vinegar
is consumed. A creature drinking pure vinegar must
succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be nauseated
for 3 rounds. A blood pudding does not infuse itself
again with this creature for one day.

#Pudding, Stone 118
Acid (Ex): A stone pudding
secretes a digestive acid
that dissolves organic material
and stone, but not
metal. Any melee attack deals
acid damage. Clothing dissolves
and becomes useless immediately unless
it succeeds on a DC 21 Reflex save. A stone or
wooden weapon that strikes a stone pudding dissolves
immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 21 Reflex save.
The save DCs are Constitution-based.
The pudding's acidic touch deals 21 points of damage
per round to wooden or stone objects (including creatures
it has turned to stone), but the pudding must
remain in contact with the object for 1 full round to deal
this damage.
Petrification (Ex): The touch of a stone pudding
turns an opponent permanently to stone if it fails a DC
21 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Blindsight (Ex): A stone pudding's entire body is a
primitive sensory organ that allows it to ascertain prey
by scent and vibration within 60 feet.
Camouflage (Ex): It takes a DC 20 Spot check to
notice a non-moving stone pudding before it attacks.
Anyone with ranks in Survival or Craft (stonemasonry)
can use one of those skills instead of Spot to notice the
creature. Dwarves can use stonecunning to notice a
stone pudding.
Vulnerability (Ex): A stone pudding is slowed (as by
a slow spell) for 3 rounds if stone to flesh is cast on it. The
stone pudding does not receive a save against this effect.
Skills: A stone pudding can always choose to take 10
on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.

#Quasi-Elemental, Acid 120
Acid (Ex): Acid quasi-elementals are living creatures of
acid; any melee hit deals acid damage. Creatures hitting an acid
quasi-elemental unarmed or with natural attacks take acid
damage as though hit by the quasi-elemental's slam attack.
Drench (Ex): The quasi-elemental's touch puts out
torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames
of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or smaller. The
creature can dispel magical fire as dispel magic (caster level
equals the quasi-elemental's HD).
Fumes (Ex): The fumes from an acid quasi-elemental's body
act as an inhalant poison. Creatures within 5 feet of an acid
quasi-elemental must succeed on a Fortitude save each round or
suffer 1 point of Constitution damage. One minute later another
Fortitude save (same DC) must be made to avoid another 1d4
points of Constitution damage. The save DC is Constitution-
based. See the sidebar for the appropriate statistics.
Skills: An acid quasi-elemental has a +8 racial bonus on
any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a
hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check,
even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action
while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

#Quasi-Elemental, Obsidian 124
Death Throes (Ex): When reduced to 0 or less
hit points, an obsidian quasi-elemental explodes
in a cloud of razor-sharp bits of obsidian. A creature
caught in the area can make a Reflex save for
half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
See the sidebar for the appropriate statistics for
each elemental's death throes.
Molten Glass (Ex): A successful hit against an obsidian
quasi-elemental with a piercing or slashing weapon
(or piercing or slashing natural attack) that deals damage
equal to the quasi-elemental's current HD opens a
wound that spurts molten glass. The wound bleeds for
1d4 rounds and any creature within 5 feet must make a
Reflex save or take fire damage from the splash. A new
save must be made each round the wound bleeds and a
creature is within the area. The save DC is Constitution-
based. See the sidebar for the appropriate statistics.

#Rakklethorn Toad 124
Poison (Ex): A rakklethorn toad deals poison with its
thorns. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Rakklethorn Toad Poison: Injury, Fortitude DC 13; initial
and secondary damage 1d6 Dexterity.
If a rakkelthorn toad is killed or subdued before it has fired
all of its thorns in a given day, the poison can be extracted
from its remaining thorns. A successful DC 16 Heal or DC
16 Craft (alchemy) check allows the poison to be changed
into a mild anesthetic; one rakkelthorn toad provides
enough for one dose. A single dose of this anesthetic,
applied to the wound of an injured creature, provides a +2
circumstance bonus to Heal checks (multiple doses do not
stack). This bonus lasts for one hour, after which time the
anesthesia wears off. Poison cannot be extracted from
thorns that have been fired by the rakklethorn.
Thorns (Ex): From its back, a rakklethorn toad can fire
a volley of thorns once per round as a standard action. All
thorns in the cluster either hit or miss their target and deal
1d6 points of damage plus poison (see above). This attack
has a range of 50 feet with no range increment. The
rakklethorn toad can launch a total of 6 such volleys per day.

rakklethorn toad has a +6 racial bonus on Hide checks.

#Rat, Barrow 125
Stone Skin (Su): Once per day, as a standard
action, a barrow rat can toughen its skin to the
hardness of stone. It gains damage reduction 5/- for
1 minute.
Swarm (Ex): Barrow rats crawl over each other in
an attempt to swarm an opponent. Up to four barrow
rats can occupy a single 5-foot space.

on Hide and Move Silently checks and a +8
racial bonus on Balance checks. They use
their Dexterity modifier for Climb checks.
A barrow rat can always take 10 on a
Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.

#Red Jester 126
Fear Cackle (Su): A red jester can unleash a fear-inducing
cackle as a free action. Anyone within 60 feet that hears it must
succeed on a DC 22 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds.
Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is
immune to the same red jester's fear cackle for one day. The save
DC is Charisma-based.
Jester's Deck (Su): The red jester uses a deck of playing cards
in combat that functions as a deck of many things (see the DMG).
Once per round, as a standard action, the red jester can draw a
single card and throw it at an opponent to a range of 20 feet. This
requires a successful ranged touch attack. If successful, the card
takes effect that round and affects the target just as if he had drawn
a card from a deck of many things. A red jester can draw the same
card more than once. The playing cards only function in the hands
of a red jester. To anyone else, they are merely normal playing
cards.
Merriment (Su): If a red jester strikes an opponent with its
mace, the creature must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or fall to
the ground laughing for 1d3 rounds. The opponent is not helpless,
but cannot take any action. A mace of merriment functions only in
the hands of a red jester. In the hands of any other creature it
functions as a masterwork light mace.
Unassailable Mind (Ex): Anyone targeting a red jester with a
thought detection, mind control, or telepathic ability must
succeed on a DC 20 Will save or suffer the effects of an insanity spell
(caster level 15th). The save DC is Charisma-based.

checks.

#Redcap 127
Poison (Ex): Redcaps often employ special poisons
extracted from aconite plants. Aconite poison is
crafted by redcaps so they always carry a generous
supply with them.
Aconite Poison: Injury, Fortitude DC 15; initial
and secondary damage 1d4 Constitution.
A redcap often coats its weapons with this poison.
In such a case, the poison lasts for 1 minute or until
it is touched or scores a successful hit. The redcap
may coat a single weapon with poison as a standard
action.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will-invisibility; 1/day-
dancing lights, detect good, glitterdust (DC 14), mirror
image, ventriloquism (DC 13). Caster level 7th. The

racial bonus on Hide
checks in a forest
setting.

#Renzer (Devilfin) 128
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a renzer must
hit an opponent up to one size larger with its bite attack. It
can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without
provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple
check, it establishes a hold and deals bite damage each
round the hold is maintained.
Command Fish (Su): Twice per day, a renzer can command
fish and aquatic creatures as the mass charm spell
(caster level 8th). The renzer can communicate with any
creature it currently commands as if by speak with animals.

to take 10 on a Swim
check, even if distracted
or endangered. It can use
the run action while swimming,
provided it swims
in a straight line.

#Retch Hound 129
Breath Weapon (Su): Once per minute, a retch
hound can belch forth digestive juices in a 10-foot
cone. Affected creatures take 2d6 points of acid
damage and are nauseated for 1d3 rounds. A successful
DC 13 Reflex save halves the acid damage and
prevents the nausea. The save DC is Constitution-
based.
Stench (Ex): All living creatures (except other
retch hounds) within 30 feet of a retch hound must
succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or be sickened for
10 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures
that successfully save cannot be affected by the
same retch hound's stench for 24 hours. A delay
poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect
from the sickened creature. Creatures with immunity
to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to
poison receive their normal bonus on their saving
throws.
Trip (Ex): A retch hound that hits with a bite
attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+2 check
modifier) as a free action without making a touch
attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the
attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the
retch hound.
Skills: Because of its multiple eyes, a retch hound
has a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Search checks.
Retch hounds have a +4 racial bonus on Survival
checks when tracking by scent.

#Riptide Horror 130

ascertain all foes within 30 feet using sound, scent, and vibration.
Spider Climb (Sp): At will, a riptide horror can create an effect
identical to a spider climb spell (caster level 6th).
Vulnerable to Electricity (Ex): The riptide horror takes half
again as much damage (+50%) as normal from electricity,
regardless of whether a save is allowed, or if the save is a success or
failure.
Skills: *A riptide horror receives a +10 racial bonus to Hide
checks in murky water.
A riptide horror has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose
to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It
can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a
straight line.

a critical on a natural 19-20 with a wing
slash. A successful critical hit deals triple damage.

sabrewing's wing slash does not heal naturally
and resists healing spells. A creature attempting to cast a cure spell or heal spell on a creature
damaged by the sabrewing's wing slash must succeed
on a DC 18 caster level check, or the spell
has no effect on the injured character. The check
DC is Constitution-based.
Spell-Like Abilities: 3/day-magic weapon,
align weapon; 1/day-greater magic weapon. Caster
level 8th.
The sabrewing can use its spell-like abilities on
its wings.
See Invisible (Su): Sabrewings have a continuous
see invisibility ability, as the spell (caster
level 8th).

#Sand Kraken 136
Camouflage (Ex): Because it remains buried until it attacks,
it takes a successful Spot check (DC 20) to detect the presence
of a sand kraken before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in Survival
or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Spot
to notice the sand kraken.
Constrict (Ex): A sand kraken deals 1d6+5 points of damage
with a successful grapple check.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the sand kraken
must hit an opponent of any size with a tentacle attack. It can
then attempt a grapple check as a free action without provoking
an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes
a hold and can constrict or bite an opponent each round
the hold is maintained. A sand kraken gains a +4 racial bonus to
grapple checks which is already included in its statistics block.
Tentacles (Ex): The only part of a sand kraken that is
normally exposed is its tentacles. A single tentacle is AC 20
(touch 14) and has 15 hit points. The loss of a tentacle does not
harm the sand kraken (i.e., damage done to a tentacle does not
count against its total hit points). Lost tentacles regrow in 1d4
days.
Tremorsense (Ex): A sand kraken can automatically sense
the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with the
ground.

#Sand Stalker 137
Attraction (Ex): The sand stalker's front four legs
are hollow. When a gust of air or wind blows across
them, they create a hypnotic sound that captivates
all creatures within a 100-foot spread that fail a DC
15 Will save. This is a sonic, mind-affecting charm
effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be
affected again by the same sand stalker's attraction
for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.
A captivated victim walks toward the sand stalker,
taking the most direct route possible. If the path
leads into a dangerous area, (fire, over a cliff, and so
on), that creature gets a second saving throw. Captivated
creatures can take no actions other than to
defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the sand
stalker stands there and offers no resistance to the
monster's attacks. The effect continues for as long as
the sand stalker's legs are subjected to wind. A bard's
countersong ability allows the entranced creature to
attempt a new Will save.
Poison (Ex): A sand stalker delivers a highly toxic
poison with a successful bite attack. The save is
Constitution-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.
Sand Stalker Poison: Injury, Fortitude DC 19 negates,
initial damage is paralysis for 1d4+1 rounds.

each round the victim is paralyzed.

sense the location of anything within 60 feet
that is in contact with the ground.

Hide checks, a +6 racial bonus on Jump checks, and
a +8 racial bonus on Spot
checks. *In sandy areas,
the Hide bonus increases
to +8.

#Screaming Skull (Cacophony Golem) 138
Cacophony (Su): When a living creature
comes within 40 feet of a screaming
skull, it releases an ear-shattering roar of
tumultuous sounds as a free action that
can be heard up to 1,000 feet away.
Affected creatures within 60 feet must
succeed on a DC 13 Will save or take 1d6
points of sonic damage each round until
they leave the area. Spellcasters within the
area must succeed on a Concentration check
(DC 10 + sonic damage taken) to successfully cast a
spell. The screaming lasts 1d4 rounds before ceasing
for one round. After that, the skull remains silent
unless a creature moves within 40 feet of it-it then
screams again and repeats the above cycle. The save
DC is Constitution-based.
This cacophonous scream increases the chance of
wandering monsters by +20%, who come to investigate
the source of the disturbance.
Insanity (Su): An opponent that touches a screaming
skull (including with natural or unarmed attacks)
must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be stricken
insane as by an insanity spell (caster level 6th). The
save DC is Constitution-based.
Magic Missile (Su): Once per round, a screaming
skull can produce a magic missile from its eyes, as the
spell (caster level 6th). The screaming skull can
release 3 missiles each round using this ability, and
(unlike the spell) an opponent can attempt a DC 13
Reflex save to avoid a missile. The save DC is Constitution-
based.
