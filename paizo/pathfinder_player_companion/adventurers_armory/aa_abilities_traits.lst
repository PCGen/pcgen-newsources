###Block: Equipment Traits
# Ability Name		Unique Key					Category of Ability		Type					Multiple Requirements																					Description																																																													Stackable?	Multiple?	Choose								Class Skill		Source Page
Augmented Disguise	KEY:Augmented Disguise ~ Trait	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.EquipmentTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Augmented Disguise ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.EquipmentTrait]	DESC:You are especially good at disguising yourself when you have props available.	BENEFIT:You gain a +2 trait bonus on Disguise checks when wearing a wig, false beard, or similar large prop, or if you are wearing a special costume or eye-catching bauble that reinforces your disguise.	STACK:NO	SOURCEPAGE:p.30
Dealmaker	KEY:Dealmaker ~ Trait	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.EquipmentTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Dealmaker ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.EquipmentTrait]	DESC:You have the air of a person with money, allowing you to buy and sell valuables that otherwise are too rich for the local community.	BENEFIT:Once per week, when looking for an item with a price greater than the local community’s base value (see page 461 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook), make a DC 10 Diplomacy check; add 10 to the DC for each community size category between the current community and the community size with a base value sufficient for that item. Success means (with GM approval) you’re able to sell or purchase that item as if the local community were of sufficient size. Each additional attempt (successful or otherwise) in that community increases the DC by an additional +10. Example: If you’re trying to find a +1 cloak of resistance (1,000 gp), you’d normally need to be in a small town (base value 1,000 gp) or larger to be able to find that item with little trouble. If you’re currently in a hamlet, that’s two community sizes away from a small town, so the Diplomacy DC is 30. If you went to a village and asked there, the DC would only be 20 because it’s only one community size away from a small town.	STACK:NO	SOURCEPAGE:p.30
Extremely Fashionable	KEY:Extremely Fashionable ~ Trait	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.EquipmentTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Extremely Fashionable ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.EquipmentTrait]	DESC:You really know how to make a good impression when you're dressed well.	BENEFIT:Whenever you are wearing clothing and/or jewelry worth at least 150 gp (and not otherwise covered in gore, sewage, or other things that mar your overall look), you gain a +1 trait bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks. One of these skills (your choice) is a class skill for you.	STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NUMCHOICES=1|SKILL|Bluff|Diplomacy|Intimidate	CSKILL:LIST		SOURCEPAGE:p.332
#TODO Don't know how to make Heirloom Weapon actually do anything...
Heirloom Weapon	KEY:Heirloom Weapon ~ Trait	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.EquipmentTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Heirloom Weapon ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.EquipmentTrait]	DESC:You carry a non-masterwork simple or martial weapon that has been passed down from generation to generation in your family.	BENEFIT:TODO	STACK:NO	SOURCEPAGE:p.30
Improvisational Equipment	KEY:Improvisational Equipment ~ Trait	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.EquipmentTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Improvisational Equipment ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.EquipmentTrait]	DESC:You have an uncanny knack for turning equipment to new and unexpected uses.	BENEFIT:When using an item for anything other than its intended purpose—such as using a crowbar as a grappling hook or an old shirt to bandage a deadly wound - reduce the improvisation penalty by 2. This does not apply to improvised weapon penalties. Your GM may rule that some things are just not suitable for use in certain ways; for example, gluing a dead orc’s face to your own face won’t help you disguise yourself as an orc.	STACK:NO	SOURCEPAGE:p.30
Iron Liver	KEY:Iron Liver ~ Trait	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.EquipmentTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Iron Liver ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.EquipmentTrait]	DESC:Due to a lucky constitution or frequent exposure, your body is resistant to poison, including alcohol and drugs.	BENEFIT:You gain a +2 trait bonus on Fortitude saves against poison and drugs, and a +4 trait bonus on Fortitude saves to avoid the effects of alcohol.	STACK:NO	SOURCEPAGE:p.30
Power of Suggestion	KEY:Power of Suggestion ~ Trait	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.EquipmentTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Power of Suggestion ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.EquipmentTrait]	DESC:People trust your words over their own eyes.	BENEFIT:You may make a Bluff check to make observers believe that an object in your possession is actually a different object entirely. The DC for the check is 20 for items of a similar size, shape, and color (such as a glaive and a quarterstaff). Items of a different shape, size, or color raise the DC by 5 for each dissimilar aspect, or more if the dissimilarity is extreme. This deception lasts 1 minute; if the item is still in view, the observers may recognize their error unless you make another bluff check.	STACK:NO	SOURCEPAGE:p.30
Prehensile Whip	KEY:Prehensile Whip ~ Trait	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.EquipmentTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Prehensile Whip ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.EquipmentTrait]	DESC:In your hand a whip has a life of its own, wrapping around pillars and beams with ease.	BENEFIT:You can use a whip as if it were a rope with a grappling hook at the end. Attaching your whip is a standard action, but detaching it is a full-round action.	STACK:NO	SOURCEPAGE:p.31
Quick Learner	KEY:Quick Learner ~ Trait	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.EquipmentTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Quick Learner ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.EquipmentTrait]	DESC:You're skilled at learning the feel of a particular weapon after a few swings in combat.	BENEFIT:After your first attack with a weapon in which you are not proficient, the non-proficiency penalty decreases by 2 (to a –2 penalty). This effect lasts only while you have the weapon in hand; you must “relearn” the weapon each time you pick it up.	STACK:NO	SOURCEPAGE:p.31
Rough and Ready	KEY:Rough and Ready ~ Trait	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.EquipmentTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Rough and Ready ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.EquipmentTrait]	DESC:Your intense familiarity with the tools of your trade allows you to use them in combat as if they were actual weapons and makes them more effective for that purpose than they would normally be.	BENEFIT:When you use a tool of your trade (requiring at least 1 rank in the appropriate Craft or Profession skill) as a weapon, you do not take the improvised weapon penalty and instead receive a +1 trait bonus on your attack. This trait is commonly used with shovels, picks, blacksmith hammers, and other sturdy tools - lutes and brooms make terribly fragile weapons.	STACK:NO	SOURCEPAGE:p.31
Stage Magic	KEY:Stage Magic ~ Trait	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.EquipmentTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Stage Magic ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.EquipmentTrait]	DESC:You have put in many hours practicing with flashy alchemical items that enhance your Perform skill.	BENEFIT:When you use an attention-getting alchemical item such as a flask of alchemist’s fire, smokestick, thunderstone, or another appropriate alchemical item (GM's discretion) as part of a performance, you gain a +2 trait bonus on your Perform check for the duration of that performance. The item is expended without its normal effects and only serves to make your performance more impressive; for example, you could pretend to ignite yourself with alchemist's fire as part of a Perform (comedy) check or make a dramatic appearance with a smokestick as part of a Perform (act) check, but you would not actually take fire damage or gain concealment from smoke.	STACK:NO	SOURCEPAGE:p.31
Stealthy Escape	KEY:Stealthy Escape ~ Trait	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.EquipmentTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Stealthy Escape ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.EquipmentTrait]	DESC:You are adept at escaping from confinement in an unobtrusive manner.	BENEFIT:When trying to escape manacles, rope, or other similar restraints (but not grapples or similar attacks), you may make a Sleight of Hand check instead of your Escape Artist modifier. If you free yourself, you gain a +2 trait bonus on Bluff checks to pretend that you are still bound.	STACK:NO	SOURCEPAGE:p.31
Thrown-Together Fashion	KEY:Thrown-Together Fashion ~ Trait	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.EquipmentTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Thrown-Together Fashion ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.EquipmentTrait]	DESC:You can modify old clothing to make it effective in new circumstances.	BENEFIT:With a basic sewing kit or disguise kit, you can make a Disguise check to change one outfit into another outfit. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + the gp difference between costs of the outfits. The alteration takes 10 minutes per 1-gp difference in the cost of the outfits.	STACK:NO	SOURCEPAGE:p.31
