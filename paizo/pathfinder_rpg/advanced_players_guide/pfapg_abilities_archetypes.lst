As long as they can hear the performance, affected creatures may not attack or flee until they have eliminated every such effect, though they are freed from this compulsion immediately if attacked. Creatures in the area must make this save each round the bard continues his performance. This ability is language-dependent and requires audible components. This performance replaces inspire heroics.

Once the bard begins using this performance, he tracks the number of rounds it has been in use. While performing, as an immediate action, he can attempt to counter any spell that he can identify using Spellcraft, so long as that spell's level is equal or less than the total number of rounds he has been performing spell suppression. The attempt to counter the spell is made as if using dispel magic, using the bard's level as the caster level. If successful, the bardic performance immediately ends. This ability requires audible components. This performance replaces dirge of doom.
Metamagic Mastery		KEY:Bard Magician ~ Metamagic Mastery	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.BardFrighteningTune		DESC:At 14th level, a magician can use performance to apply a metamagic feat to a spell he is about to cast without increasing the casting time.

This performance replaces frightening tune.
Magical Talent		KEY:Bard Magician ~ Magical Talent		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.BardCounterSong		DESC:A magician gains a bonus equal to half his level on Knowledge (arcana), Spellcraft, and Use Magic Device checks. This ability replaces bardic knowledge. Improved Counterspell: A magician gains Improved Counterspell as a bonus feat. This ability replaces countersong.

The performance effect lingers for 1 extra round per level of the spell. Only one spell may be sacrificed per performance, and performance types that take affect after a specific number of rounds cannot be extended. This ability replaces well-versed.
Expanded Repertoire	KEY:Bard Magician ~ Expanded Repertoire	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.BardVersatilePerformance	DESC:At 2nd level and every four levels thereafter, a magician can add one spell to his spells known from the spell list of any arcane spellcasting class.

# Sandman
Stealspell			KEY:Bard Sandman ~ Stealspell			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.BardInspireCourage		DESC:A sandman can use performance to steal spells from his foes and add them to his list of spells known. Once the performance is started, the bard can steal a prepared spell or a spell known from another creature with a touch attack as a standard action. The target receives a Will save (DC 10 + the bard's level + the bard's Cha bonus) to negate the effect. The sandman may choose a spell to steal, but if the target does not possess the spell, the bardic performance immediately ends. Otherwise the spell stolen is random, but it is always of the highest level that the bard can cast, if possible. The target loses the prepared spell or spell known and the sandman adds it to his list of spells known for as long as the performance continues, after which it reverts to the original recipient. While stolen, the bard can cast the spell using his available spell slots. This use does not consume the stolen spell. If the bard steals another spell while a spell is stolen, the previous spell immediately reverts to its original owner. This ability requires visual components. This performance replaces inspire courage.
Slumber Song		KEY:Bard Sandman ~ Slumber Song		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike.BardSuggestion			DESC:At 6th level, a sandman can use his performance to cause a creature he has already fascinated to fall asleep (as deep slumber, but with no HD limit).

Observers must succeed at a Perception check opposed by a sandman's Sleight of Hand check to notice that the sandman is the source of the spellcasting (though spellcasting still provokes attacks of opportunity). The bard must use this performance for at least 2 rounds before casting a spell; otherwise he is automatically detected and the performance ends. This ability replaces inspire greatness.
Greater Stealspell	KEY:Bard Sandman ~ Greater Stealspell	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.BardInspireHeroics		DESC:A sandman's stealspell power improves at 15th level. When a target fails a save against his stealspell performance, the sandman discovers its spell resistance (if any) and all spells it has prepared or knows. He can then choose which spell to steal. The sandman may forgo stealing a spell and instead reduce the target's SR by an amount equal to half his bard level and gain that amount of spell resistance for as long as he continues performing. If he steals additional spell resistance, it stacks with previously stolen SR. If he steals a spell or ceases performing, the spell resistance immediately reverts back to its owner. This performance replaces inspire heroics.
Mass Slumber Song		KEY:Bard Sandman ~ Mass Slumber Song	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike.BardMassSuggestion		DESC:At 18th level, a sandman can use slumber song to affect any number of fascinated creatures within 30 feet. Otherwise, this ability functions like mass suggestion. This performance replaces mass suggestion.
Spell Catching		KEY:Bard Sandman ~ Spell Catching		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.BardDeadlyPerformace		DESC:At 20th level, a sandman who saves against a spell or spell-like ability that targets only him (not including area spells) may use bardic performance as an immediate action. He must attempt a caster level check (DC 10 + the spell's original caster level). If it succeeds, the sandman can absorb the spell effect without harm and immediately recast that spell (using the original caster's level and save DC) or any spell he knows of that level or lower. Using this ability consumes a number of rounds of bardic performance equal to the spell's level, even if the check fails. This performance replaces deadly performance.
Master of Deception	KEY:Bard Sandman ~ Master of Deception	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.BardBardicKnowledge		DESC:A sandman gains a bonus equal to half his level on Bluff, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks. He may also disarm magical traps with Disable Device as a rogue's trapfinding ability. This ability replaces bardic knowledge.
Sneakspell			KEY:Bard Sandman ~ Sneakspell			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.BardVersatilePerformace	DESC:At 2nd level, a sandman adds +1 to the save DC of spells and bardic performance against opponents who are denied their Dex bonus. This increases to +2 at 10th level and +3 at 18th level. In addition, at 6th level he gains a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance against such foes, and this bonus increases to +4 at 14th level. This ability replaces versatile performance.
Trap Sense			KEY:Bard Sandman ~ Trap Sense			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.BardInspireCompetence	DESC:At 3rd level, a sandman gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves against traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against traps.

When he confirms a critical hit, he can start this performance as an immediate action (ending any other performances). He gains temporary hit points equal to his Charisma modifier (if positive), and all allies within 30 feet gain a +1 morale bonus on their next attack roll prior to the start of his next turn. These temporary hit points remain until the bard ends his performance. This performance replaces fascinate.
Incite Rage			KEY:Bard Savage Skald ~ Incite Rage			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.BardSuggestion			DESC:At 6th level, a savage skald can induce a furious rage in one creature within 30 feet. This effect functions as a rage spell that lasts as long as the target can hear the bard's performance; however, unwilling creatures can be affected if they fail a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier). Success renders the target immune to this power for 24 hours. The bard cannot target himself with this ability. If the target has the rage class feature, it can instead immediately rage and stay in this rage without consuming rounds of rage per day as long as the bard continues performing. This mind-affecting effect requires audible components. This performance replaces suggestion.

Sea Shanty			KEY:Bard Sea Singer ~ Sea Shanty		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.BardCounterSong		DESC:A sea singer learns to counter seasickness and exhaustion during long sea voyages. Each round of a sea shanty, he makes a Perform skill check. Allies within 30 feet (including the sea singer) may use his Perform check in place of a saving throw against becoming exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, or sickened; if already under such an effect, a new save is allowed each round of the sea shanty, using the bard's Perform check for the save. A sea shanty has no effect on instantaneous effects or effects that do not allow saves. This ability requires audible components. This performance replaces countersong.

World Traveler		KEY:Bard Sea Singer ~ World Traveler	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.BardBardicKnowledge		DESC:A sea singer gains a bonus equal to half his bard level on Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (local), Knowledge (nature), and Linguistics checks.

All creatures within 30 feet that fail a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier) treat one creature chosen by the bard as if it were invisible. This performance affects one additional creature at 5th level and every 6 levels thereafter. If the targets take any action that would cause them to become visible, they become visible to everyone. The bard cannot use this ability on himself. This ability is a mind-affecting effect that requires visual components. This performance replaces inspire courage.
Harmless Performer	KEY:Bard Street Performer ~ Harmless Performer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.BardInspireCompetence	DESC:At 3rd level, a street performer can use performance to appear meek and unworthy of being attacked. While using this performance, whenever an enemy targets the street performer, the enemy must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha bonus) or be unable to attack the bard this round, as per sanctuary. The enemy loses the attack that targeted the bard, but may spend additional attacks targeting other creatures.

# Air School	
Air Supremacy	KEY:Air School ~ Air Supremacy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:You gain a +2 enhancement bonus on Fly skill checks. This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess. In addition, you can cast feather fall on yourself at will. At 5th level, you can cast levitate on yourself at will. At 10th level, you can cast fly on yourself at will. At 20th level, whenever you make a Fly skill check, assume the roll resulted in a natural 20.
Lightning Flash	KEY:Air School ~ Lightning Flash	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:As a standard action, you can unleash a flash of electricity. This flash deals 1d6 points of electricity damage + 1 point for every two wizard levels you possess to all creatures within 5 feet of you and dazzles them for 1d4 rounds. A successful Reflex save negates the dazzled effect and halves the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier.

Cyclone		KEY:Air School ~ Cyclone		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 8th level, you can create a vortex of turbulent wind around yourself as a standard action. This vortex has a radius of up to 10 feet and a maximum height of 10 feet per wizard level you possess. Any ranged attack passing through this vortex automatically misses. Any flying creature moving through the vortex must make a Fly skill check or immediately fall from the sky, taking falling damage (the creature cannot make a Fly check to reduce or negate this damage). Creatures on the ground cannot pass through the vortex without first making a Strength check. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + your caster level. The vortex is faintly visible and can be spotted with a DC 15 Perception skill check. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

# Earth School		
Earth Supremacy	KEY:Earth School ~ Earth Supremacy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your CMD to resist bull rush, pull, push, reposition, trip, and overrun attempts as long as you are touching the ground. This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess. In addition, you gain a +1 insight bonus on melee attack and damage rolls whenever both you and your foe are touching the ground. At 20th level, earth and stone do not block the line of effect of your spells, although they do still block your line of sight.
Acid Cloud		KEY:Earth School ~ Acid Cloud		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:As a standard action, you can create a 5-foot-radius cloud of acid vapor within 30 feet that lasts for 1 round. This cloud deals 1d6 points of acid damage + 1 point for every two wizard levels you possess to all creatures in the cloud and sickens them for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save negates the sickened effect and halves the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Creatures that begin their turn inside the cloud can move out that turn without penalty, but those that enter the cloud are affected. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.
Earth Glide		KEY:Earth School ~ Earth Glide	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 8th level, you gain the ability to move through earth, dirt, and stone for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. You cannot move through worked earth or stone; only natural substances can be traversed. If your total duration expires before you exit the earth, you are flung back to the point where you entered the stone, take 4d6 points of damage, and are stunned for 1 round. Your burrowing does not leave a hole, nor does it give any sign of your presence (although you can be detected by creatures with tremorsense). These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

# Fire School		
Fire Supremacy	KEY:Fire School ~ Fire Supremacy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:You gain resistance 5 to fire. At 10th level, this resistance increases to 10. At 20th level, you gain immunity to fire damage. In addition, whenever you are within 5 feet of a source of flame at least as large as a campfire, you can draw the fire around you for 1 round as a swift action. Anyone striking you with a melee weapon or unarmed strike takes an amount of fire damage equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). Weapons with reach avoid this damage.
Fire Jet		KEY:Fire School ~ Fire Jet		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:As a standard action, you can send forth a 20-foot line of fire. Anyone in this line takes 1d6 points of fire damage + 1 point for every two wizard levels you possess. A successful Reflex save halves this damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Creatures that fail their saving throw catch fire and take 1d6 points of fire damage on the following round. Creatures that catch fire can avoid this damage by taking a full-round action to extinguish the flames by making a DC 15 Reflex save. Rolling on the ground gives a +2 circumstance bonus on the save. Dousing the creature with water automatically extinguishes the flame. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.
Dancing Flame	KEY:Fire School ~ Dancing Flame	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 8th level, as a standard action, you can sculpt fire to suit your desires. With one use of this ability you can move any nonmagical fire up to 30 feet. Alternatively you can use this ability to alter any fire spell that you cast with a duration of instantaneous by removing any number of squares from its area of affect. If the fire spell has a duration, you can use this ability to reposition the spell, within its original range (treat this as if you had just cast the spell, even though the duration is unchanged). You cannot use this ability on a fire spell that you did not cast. If you move a nonmagical flame, it must have a new source of fuel. If it does not, it is extinguished in one round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your wizard level.

# Water School		
Water Supremacy	KEY:Water School ~ Water Supremacy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:You gain a +2 enhancement bonus on Swim skill checks. This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess. In addition, you can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to four times your Constitution score before you must start making checks to avoid drowning. At 10th level, you gain a swim speed equal to your base speed. At 20th level, whenever you make a Swim skill check, assume the roll resulted in a natural 20.
Cold Blast		KEY:Water School ~ Cold Blast		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:As a standard action, you can unleash a blast of freezing cold. This blast deals 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point for every two wizard levels you possess to all creatures within 5 feet of you and staggers them for 1 round. A successful Reflex save negates the staggered effect and halves the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.
Wave			KEY:Water School ~ Wave			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 8th level, you can create a wave of water that starts at your location and moves 30 feet per round away from you in a direction of your choosing. Creatures struck by the wave might be knocked down and pushed away. Make a caster level check against the CMD of each creature struck. If you succeed, the creature is knocked prone. If your check exceeds the CMD of the creature by 5 or more, it is carried with the wave during the waves movement this round. You receive a +5 bonus on this check if the creature shares its space with the wave at the start of your turn (when the wave moves). Creatures carried in this way can move out of the wave on their turn if they succeed on a Strength check (DC = 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your Intelligence modifier), but they cannot breathe while sharing space with the wave. The wave is up to 20 feet high and up to 5 feet long for each wizard level you possess. Nonmagical fires hit by the wave are automatically extinguished. Magical fire effects are unaffected. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 1/2 your wizard level.
