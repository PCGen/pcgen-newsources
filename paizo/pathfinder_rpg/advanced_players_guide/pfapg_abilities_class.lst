Bomb				KEY:Bomb ~ Alchemist			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	DESC:%1/Bombs per day. Bombs are considered weapons and can be selected using feats such as Point-Blank Shot and Weapon Focus. On a direct hit, the bomb inflicts %2d%3+%4 points of fire damage. Splash damage %5 points with Reflex save DC %6 for half damage.|BombsUseableTimes|BombDamageSize|BombDamageNumber|BombDamageBonus|BombSplashDamage|BombDC				DEFINE:BombsUseableTimes|0	DEFINE:BombDamageSize|6		DEFINE:BombDamageNumber|0			DEFINE:BombDamageBonus|0	DEFINE:BombSplashDamage|BombDamageNumber+BombDamageBonus	DEFINE:BombDC|0
Mutagen			KEY:Mutagen ~ Alchemist			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, an alchemist discovers how to create a mutagen that he can imbibe in order to heighten his physical prowess at the cost of his personality. It takes 1 hour to brew a dose of mutagen, and once brewed, it remains potent until used. An alchemist can only maintain one dose of mutagen at a time - if he brews a second dose, any existing mutagen becomes inert. As with an extract or bomb, a mutagen that is not in an alchemist's possession becomes inert until an alchemist picks it up again. When an alchemist brews a mutagen, he selects one physical ability score - either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. It's a standard action to drink a mutagen. Upon being imbibed, the mutagen causes the alchemist to grow bulkier and more bestial, granting him a +2 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to the selected ability score for 10 minutes per alchemist level. In addition, while the mutagen is in effect, the alchemist takes a -2 penalty to one of his mental ability scores. If the mutagen enhances his Strength, it applies a penalty to his Intelligence. If it enhances his Dexterity, it applies a penalty to his Wisdom. If it enhances his Constitution, it applies a penalty to his Charisma. A non-alchemist who drinks a mutagen must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier) or become nauseated for 1 hour - a non-alchemist can never gain the benefit of a mutagen, but an alchemist can gain the effects of another alchemist's mutagen if he drinks it. (Although if the other alchemist creates a different mutagen, the effects of the "stolen" mutagen immediately cease.) The effects of a mutagen do not stack. Whenever an alchemist drinks a mutagen, the effects of any previous mutagen immediately end.
Throw Anything		KEY:Throw Anything ~ Alchemist	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	DESC:All alchemists gain the Throw Anything feat as a bonus feat at 1st level. An alchemist adds his Intelligence modifier to damage done with splash weapons, including the splash damage if any. This bonus damage is already included in the bomb class feature.	AUTO:FEAT|Throw Anything
Discovery			KEY:Discovery ~ Alchemist		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 2nd level, and then again every 2 levels thereafter (up to 18th level), an alchemist makes an incredible alchemical discovery. Unless otherwise noted, an alchemist cannot select an individual discovery more than once. Some discoveries can only be made if the alchemist has met certain prerequisites first, such as uncovering other discoveries. Discoveries that modify bombs that are marked with an asterisk (*) do not stack. Only one such discovery can be applied to an individual bomb. The DC of any saving throw called for by a discovery is equal to %1.|DiscoveryDC	DEFINE:DiscoveryDC|0
Poison Resistance		KEY:Poison Resistance ~ Alchemist	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 2nd level, an alchemist gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against poison. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and then again to +6 at 8th level. At 10th level, an alchemist becomes completely immune to poison.
Poison Use			KEY:Poison Use ~ Alchemist		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Alchemists are trained in the use of poison and starting at 2nd level, cannot accidentally poison themselves when applying poison to a weapon.
Swift Alchemy		KEY:Swift Alchemy ~ Alchemist		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 3rd level, an alchemist can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an alchemist half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items, and he can apply poison to a weapon as a move action.
Swift Poisoning		KEY:Swift Poisoning ~ Alchemist	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 6th level, an alchemist can apply a dose of poison to a weapon as a swift action.
Persistent Mutagen	KEY:Persistent Mutagen ~ Alchemist	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 14th level, the effects of a mutagen last for 1 hour per level.
Instant Alchemy		KEY:Instant Alchemy ~ Alchemist	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 18th level, an alchemist can create alchemical items with almost supernatural speed. He can create any alchemical item as a full-round action if he succeeds at the Craft (alchemy) check and has the appropriate resources at hand to fund the creation. He can apply poison to a weapon as an immediate action.
Grand Discovery		KEY:Grand Discovery ~ Alchemist	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 20th level, the alchemist makes a grand discovery. He immediately learns two normal discoveries, but also learns a third discovery chosen from the list below, representing a truly astounding alchemical breakthrough of signif icant import. For many alchemists, the promise of one of these grand discoveries is the primary goal of their experiments and hard work.

# Alchemist Discoveries:
Acid Bomb*			KEY:Discovery ~ Acid Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inf lict acid damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from an acid bomb take an additional 1d6 points of acid damage 1 round later.
Combine Extracts		KEY:Discovery ~ Combine Extracts	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:When the alchemist creates an extract, he can place two formulae into one extract. When the extract is consumed, both formulae take effect. This extract has a level two levels higher than the highest-level formulae placed in the extract.	PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,8
Concentrate Poison	KEY:Discovery ~ Concentrate Poison	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:The alchemist can combine two doses of the same poison to increase their effects. This requires two doses of the poison and 1 minute of concentration. When completed, the alchemist has one dose of poison. The poison's frequency is extended by 50%% and the save DC increases by +2. This poison must be used within 1 hour of its creation or it is ruined.
Concussive Bomb*		KEY:Discovery ~ Concussive Bomb	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inf lict sonic damage. Concussive bombs deal 1d4 points of sonic damage, plus 1d4 points of sonic damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. Creatures that take a direct hit from a concussive bomb are deafened for 1 minute unless they succeed at a Fortitude save.	PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,6
Delayed Bomb		KEY:Discovery ~ Delayed Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:The alchemist can place a bomb so that it explodes a number of rounds after the alchemist ceases contact with the bomb. This delay can be any number of rounds as chosen by the alchemist, up to a number of rounds equal to his level. If at any point the alchemist reclaims possession of the delayed bomb, he can end the timer and prevent the bomb's detonation. A delayed bomb detonates immediately if any other creature attempts to touch or move it, or if the bomb's contents are removed from the vial (such as if the vial breaks). The bomb deals damage as if it scored a direct hit to any creature in the square with the bomb when it detonates, and splash damage to all adjacent creatures as normal. An alchemist cannot have more than one delayed bomb at one time. If he creates another delayed bomb, the previous bomb becomes inert. Dispel magic can neutralize a delayed bomb, as can a successful Disable Device check (DC equals 10 + the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier).	PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,8
Dilution			KEY:Discovery ~ Dilution		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:Once per day, the alchemist can dilute any one potion or elixir, creating two doses of the same potion from one. Diluting a potion costs a number of gp equal to one-quarter of the potion's market value. A potion that has been diluted cannot be diluted again.This discovery cannot be used to dilute extracts or mutagens.	PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,12
Dispelling Bomb		KEY:Discovery ~ Dispelling Bomb	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it dispel magic effects instead of deal damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a dispelling bomb are subject to a targeted dispel magic spell, using the alchemist's level as the caster level. This cannot be used to target a specific spell effect. The alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.
Elixir of Life		KEY:Discovery ~ Elixir of Life	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:Once per day, the alchemist can brew an elixir of life. This special concoction costs 25,000 gp to create and takes 1 hour of work. An elixir of life, when administered by the alchemist who brewed it, restores life to a dead creature as per the spell true resurrection. Alternatively, the alchemist himself may drink the elixir of life, after which point he is immediately targeted with a resurrection spell the next time he is killed. Used in this manner, the effects of an elixir of life persist only for a number of days equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier; if he does not die before that time expires, the effects of the elixir of life end.	PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,16
Enhance Potion		KEY:Discovery ~ Enhance Potion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:A number of times per day equal to his Intelligence modifier, the alchemist can cause any potion he drinks to function at a caster level equal to his class level.
Eternal Potion		KEY:Discovery ~ Eternal Potion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:If an alchemist drinks a potion that he extends, the effects of that potion become permanent until he chooses to make another potion effect permanent.	PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,16	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Discovery ~ Extend Potion
Explosive Bomb*		KEY:Discovery ~ Explosive Bomb	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:The alchemist's bombs now have a splash radius of 10 feet rather than 5 feet. Creatures that take a direct hit from an explosive bomb catch fire, taking 1d6 points of fire damage each round until the fire is extinguished. Extinguishing the f lames is a fullround action that requires a Ref lex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target with a +2 to the save. Dousing the target with at least 2 gallons of water automatically extinguishes the f lames.
Extend Potion		KEY:Discovery ~ Extend Potion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:A number of times per day equal to his Intelligence modifier, the alchemist can cause any potion he drinks that does not have an instantaneous duration to function at twice its normal duration. This does not apply to extracts.
Fast Bombs			KEY:Discovery ~ Fast Bombs		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:An alchemist with this discovery can quickly create enough bombs to throw more than one in a single round. The alchemist can prepare and throw additional bombs as a full-round action if his base attack bonus is high enough to grant him additional attacks. This functions just like a full-attack with a ranged weapon.	PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,8
Feral Mutagen		KEY:Discovery ~ Feral Mutagen		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:Whenever the alchemist imbibes a mutagen, he gains two claw attacks and a bite attack. These are primary attacks and are made using the alchemist's full base attack bonus. The claw attacks deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if the alchemist is Small) and the bite attack deals 1d8 points of damage (1d6 if the alchemist is Small). While the mutagen is in effect, the alchemist gains a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate skill checks.
Force Bomb*			KEY:Discovery ~ Force Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict force damage. Force bombs deal 1d4 points of force damage, plus 1d4 points of force damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. Creatures that take a direct hit from a force bomb are knocked prone unless they succeed on a Ref lex save.	PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,8
Frost Bomb*			KEY:Discovery ~ Frost Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inf lict cold damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a frost bomb are staggered on their next turn unless they succeed on a Fortitude save.
Grand Mutagen		KEY:Discovery ~ Grand Mutagen		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:The alchemist's mutagen now grants a +6 natural armor bonus, a +8 alchemical bonus to one ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution), a +6 alchemical bonus to a second physical ability score, and a +4 alchemical bonus to a third physical ability score. The alchemist takes a -2 penalty to his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma as long as the mutagen persists (see Mutagen).	PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,16	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Discovery ~ Greater Mutagen
Greater Mutagen		KEY:Discovery ~ Greater Mutagen	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:The alchemist's mutagen now grants a +4 natural armor bonus, a +6 alchemical bonus to one physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution), and a +4 alchemical bonus to a second physical ability score. The alchemist takes a -2 penalty on both associated mental ability scores as long as the mutagen persists.	PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,12
Infuse Mutagen		KEY:Discovery ~ Infuse Mutagen	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:When the alchemist creates a mutagen, he can infuse it with an extra bit of his own magical power. This inf licts 2 points of Intelligence damage to the alchemist and costs 1,000 gp in rare reagents, but the mutagen created persists on its own and is not rendered inert if the alchemist creates another mutagen. This allows an alchemist to create different types of mutagens and keep them handy for emergencies. This does not allow an alchemist to gain the effects of multiple mutagens - only the most recently imbibed mutagen has any effect.
Inferno Bomb*		KEY:Discovery ~ Inferno Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb duplicate the effects of incendiary cloud instead of fog cloud, filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level.	PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,16	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Discovery ~ Smoke Bomb
Infusion			KEY:Discovery ~ Infusion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:When the alchemist creates an extract, he can infuse it with an extra bit of his own magical power. The extract created now persists even after the alchemist sets it down. As long as the extract exists, it continues to occupy one of the alchemist's daily extract slots. An infused extract can be imbibed by a non-alchemist to gain its effects.
Madness Bomb		KEY:Discovery ~ Madness Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:The alchemist's bombs do more than sear flesh - they sear the mind. A creature that takes a direct hit from a madness bomb takes damage from the bomb plus 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. Reduce the amount of normal damage dealt by the bomb by 2d6 (so a bomb that would normally deal 6d6+4 points of damage deals 4d6+4 points of damage instead). The amount of Wisdom damage dealt by a madness bomb is reduced by 1 for each madness bomb that hit the target in the past 24 hours, to a minimum of 1 point of Wisdom damage.	PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,12
Poison Bomb*		KEY:Discovery ~ Poison Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb duplicates the effects of cloudkill instead of fog cloud, filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level.	PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,12	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Discovery ~ Smoke Bomb
Precise Bombs		KEY:Discovery ~ Precise Bombs		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:Whenever the alchemist throws a bomb, he can select a number of squares equal to his Intelligence modif ier that are not affected by the splash damage from his bombs. If the bomb misses, this discovery has no effect.
Shock Bomb*			KEY:Discovery ~ Shock Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inf lict electricity damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a shock bomb are dazzled for 1d4 rounds.

The cloud functions as fog cloud, filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level.
Sticky Bomb			KEY:Discovery ~ Sticky Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:The effects of the alchemist's bombs are persistent and continue to damage creatures for 1 round after the initial damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a sticky bomb take the splash damage 1 round later. Bombs that have effects that would normally occur 1 round later instead have those effects occur 2 rounds later.	PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,10
Sticky Poison		KEY:Discovery ~ Sticky Poison		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:Any poison the alchemist creates is sticky - when the alchemist applies it to a weapon, the weapon remains poisoned for a number of strikes equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier.	PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,6
Stink Bomb*			KEY:Discovery ~ Stink Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistBasicDiscovery	DESC:The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb can duplicate the effects of stinking cloud instead of fog cloud, f illing an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round. An alchemist must possess the smoke bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.

Each cavalier's challenge also includes another effect which is listed in the section describing the cavalier's order.|CavalierChallengeTimes|CavalierChallengeLVL	DEFINE:CavalierChallengeLVL|0	DEFINE:CavalierChallengeTimes|0
Mount				KEY:Mount ~ Cavalier			CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A cavalier gains the service of a loyal and trusty steed to carry him into battle. This mount functions as a druid's animal companion, using the cavalier's level as his effective druid level. The creature must be one that he is capable of riding and is suitable as a mount. A Medium cavalier can select a camel or a horse. A Small cavalier can select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or a dog if he is at least 4th level. The GM might approve other animals as suitable mounts. A cavalier does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding his mount. The mount is always considered combat trained and begins play with Light Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat. A cavalier's mount does not gain the share spells special ability. A cavalier's bond with his mount is strong, with the pair learning to anticipate each other's moods and moves. Should a cavalier's mount die, the cavalier may find another mount to serve him after 1 week of mourning. This new mount does not gain the link, evasion, devotion, or improved evasion special abilities until the next time the cavalier gains a level.
Order				KEY:Order ~ Cavalier			CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 1st level, a cavalier must pledge himself to a specific order. The order grants the cavalier a number of bonuses, class skills, and special abilities. In addition, each order includes a number of edicts that the cavalier must follow. If he violates any of these edicts, he loses the benefits from his order's challenge ability for 24 hours. The violation of an edict is subject to GM interpretation. A cavalier cannot change his order without undertaking a lengthy process to dedicate himself to a new cause. When this choice is made, he immediately loses all of the benefits from his old order. He must then follow the edicts of his new order for one entire level without gaining any benefits from that order. Once accomplished, he gains all of the bonuses from his new order. Note that the names of these orders might vary depending upon the campaign setting or GM's preference.
Tactician			KEY:Tactician ~ Cavalier		CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 1st level, a cavalier receives a teamwork feat as a bonus feat.

Banner			KEY:Banner ~ Cavalier			CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 5th level, a cavalier's banner becomes a symbol of inspiration to his allies and companions. As long as the cavalier's banner is clearly visible, all allies within 60 feet receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made as part of a charge. At 10th level, and every five levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by +1. The banner must be at least Small or larger and must be carried or displayed by the cavalier or his mount to function.

Mighty Charge		KEY:Mighty Charge ~ Cavalier		CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	DESC:At 11th level, a cavalier learns to make devastating charge attacks while mounted. Double the threat range of any weapons wielded during a charge while mounted. This increase does not stack with other effects that increase the threat range of the weapon. In addition, the cavalier can make a free bull rush, disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver if his charge attack is successful. This free combat maneuver does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
Demanding Challenge	KEY:Demanding Challenge ~ Cavalier	CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	DESC:At 12th level, whenever a cavalier declares a challenge, his target must pay attention to the threat he poses. As long as the target is within the threatened area of the cavalier, it takes a -2 penalty to its AC from attacks made by anyone other than the cavalier.
Greater Banner		KEY:Greater Banner ~ Cavalier		CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 14th level, the cavalier's banner becomes a rallying call to his allies. All allies within 60 feet receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and compulsion spells and effects. In addition, while his banner is displayed, the cavalier can spend a standard action to wave the banner through the air, granting all allies within 60 feet an additional saving throw against any one spell or effect that is targeting them. This save is made at the original DC. Spells and effects that do not allow saving throws are unaffected by this ability. An ally cannot benefit from this ability more than once per day.
Master Tactician		KEY:Master Tactician ~ Cavalier	CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 17th level, the cavalier receives an additional teamwork feat as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. The cavalier can grant this feat to his allies using the tactician ability.

Supreme Charge		KEY:Supreme Charge ~ Cavalier		CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	DESC:At 20th level, whenever the cavalier makes a charge attack while mounted, he deals double the normal amount of damage (or triple if using a lance).

The DC is equal to 10 + the cavalier's base attack bonus.

If that judgment is changed during combat, it resets as normal.
True Judgment		KEY:True Judgment ~ Inquisitor	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 20th level, an inquisitor can call true judgment down upon a foe during combat. Whenever an inquisitor uses her judgment ability, the inquisitor can invoke true judgment on a foe as a swift action. Once declared, the inquisitor can make a single melee (or ranged attack, if the foe is within 30 feet) against the target. If the attack hits, it deals damage normally and the target must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the inquisitor's level + the inquisitor's Wisdom modifier. Once the attack is made, all of the bonuses from the inquisitor's judgments reset to those granted on the first round (although the slayer judgment remains at the maximum bonus). Regardless of whether or not the save is made, the target creature is immune to the inquisitor's true judgment ability for 24 hours.

# Summoner Special Abilities by gjorbjond
#
# Ability Name		Unique Key				Category of Ability		Type						Visible		Define									Description																																																																																																																																																																																																																			Stackable?	Multiple?	Bonus to Ability Pool							Allow Follower		Allowed Companions
Cantrips			KEY:Cantrips ~ Summoner		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																DESC:You have learned a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.
Summon Monster		KEY:Summon Monster ~ Summoner	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike					DEFINE:SMLevel|0	DEFINE:SMTimes|0	DEFINE:SMDuration|0	DESC:Summon Monster %1 (Sp) ~ (%2 per day) cast as a standard action and the creatures remain for %3 minutes (instead of %3 rounds).  Drawing upon this ability uses up the same power as the summoner uses to call his eidolon. As a result, he can only use this ability when his eidolon is not summoned.|SMLevel|SMTimes|SMDuration
Eidolon								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary				DEFINE:EidolonLevel|0							DESC:A summoner begins play with the ability to summon to his side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who, forever after, summons an aspect of the same creature. An eidolon has the same alignment as the summoner that calls it. Eidolons are treated as summoned creatures, except that they are not sent back to their home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than their Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to its summoner, an eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by protection from evil and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures. A summoner can summon his eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, the eidolon hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception to this is if the eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal hit points. The eidolon remains until dismissed by the summoner (a standard action). If the eidolon is sent back to its home plane due to damage, it cannot be summoned again until the following day. The eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of dispel magic, but spells such as dismissal and banishment work normally.															FOLLOWERS:Eidolon|1	COMPANIONLIST:Eidolon|RACETYPE=Eidolon
Life Link								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural														DESC:A close bond is formed with his eidolon. Whenever the eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, the summoner can, as a free action, sacrifice any number of hit points. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage done to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane. In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its summoner, but its maximum hit point total does return to normal.
Bond Senses								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural														DESC:As a standard action, share the senses of his eidolon, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touching everything the eidolon does. He can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. There is no range to this effect, but the eidolon and the summoner must be on the same plane. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.
Shield Ally								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary														DESC:Whenever a summoner is within his eidolon's reach, the summoner receives a +2 shield bonus to his Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on his saving throws. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.
Maker's Call							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural														DESC:As a standard action, a summoner can call his eidolon to his side. This functions as dimension door, using the summoner's caster level. When used, the eidolon appears adjacent to the summoner (or as close as possible if all adjacent spaces are occupied). If the eidolon is out of range, the ability is wasted. The summoner can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 6th.
Transposition							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural														DESC:Use maker's call ability to swap locations with eidolon. If it is larger than him, he can appear in any square occupied by the eidolon. The eidolon must occupy the square that was occupied by the summoner if able, or as close as possible if it is not able.
Aspect								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DEFINE:MasterLevel|0							DESC:Divert up to 2 points from his eidolon's evolution pool to add evolutions to himself. He cannot select any evolution that the eidolon could not possess, and he must be able to meet the requirements as well. He cannot select the ability increase evolution through this ability. Any points spent in this way are taken from the eidolon's evolution pool (reducing the total number available to the eidolon). The summoner can change the evolutions he receives from these points any time he can change the eidolon's evolutions.																																																																																																																																	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Eidolon Evolution|2
Greater Shield Ally						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural														DESC:Whenever an ally is within an eidolon's reach, the ally receives a +2 shield bonus to its Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on its saving throws. If this ally is the summoner, these bonuses increase to +4. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.
Life Bond								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural														DESC:Summoner's life becomes linked to his eidolon's. As long as the eidolon has 1 or more hit points, the summoner cannot be killed. Damage in excess of that which would kill the summoner is instead transferred to the eidolon. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as the eidolon is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with the summoner, killing him.  Effects that cause death but not damage are unaffected by this ability. This ability does not affect spells like baleful polymorph, flesh to stone, or imprisonment, or other spells that do not cause actual damage.
Merge Forms								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural														DESC:As a full-round action, a summoner can touch his eidolon and the two can merge forms. This transformation includes all of the summoner's gear. While merged in this way, the summoner is protected from harm and cannot be the target of spells or effects. All effects and spells currently targeting the summoner are suspended until the summoner emerges from the eidolon (although durations continue to expire).  The summoner can cast spells while inside the eidolon by taking control of the eidolon for the duration of the casting. Any material components used for these spells are taken from the summoner's gear, even though they are otherwise inaccessible. The summoner can direct all of the eidolon's actions while merged, can perceive through its senses, and can speak through its voice. The summoner can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. He can end this effect at any time as a swift action. The summoner emerges in a square adjacent to the eidolon if able. If the eidolon is returned to its home plane while the summoner is merged with it, the summoner is immediately ejected, taking 4d6 points of damage, and is stunned for 1 round.
Greater Aspect							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural														DESC:Summoner can divert more of his eidolon's evolutions to himself. This ability functions as the aspect ability, but up to 6 evolution points can be taken. Unlike the aspect ability, the eidolon loses 1 point from its evolution pool for every 2 points (or fraction thereof) diverted to the summoner.																																																																																																																																																																						BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Eidolon Evolution|4
Twin Eidolon							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural														DESC:Summoner and his eidolon share a true connection. As a standard action, the summoner can assume the shape of his eidolon, copying all of its evolutions, form, and abilities. His Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change to match the base scores of his eidolon. He can choose to have any gear that he carries become absorbed by his new form, as with spells from the polymorph subschool. Items with continuous effects continue to function while absorbed in this way. The summoner loses his natural attacks and all racial traits (except bonus feats, skills, and languages) in favor of the abilities granted by his eidolon's evolutions. The summoner retains all of his class features. The summoner can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to his summoner level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.
Gate				KEY:Gate ~ Summoner		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike															DESC:Summoner may cast Summon Monster 9 or Gate with his spell-like abilty.
