Allies only benefit from these bonuses while in the listed area. This ability replaces mercy.
Divine Bond		KEY:Divine Defender ~ Divine Bond		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 5th level, instead of forming a divine bond with her weapon or a mount, a divine defender can form a bond with her armor.

When called, the spirit causes the armor to shed light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants the armor a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the armor gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level.

Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 154 of the Core Rulebook). In addition, the bonuses can be consumed at the listed amount to add any of the following armor properties: energy resistance for +3 bonus, improved energy resistance for +5 bonus, or righteous* for +4 bonus. These bonuses are added to any properties the armor already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the armor is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The celestial spirit imparts no bonuses if the armor is worn by anyone other than the divine defender, but it resumes giving bonuses if the divine defender dons the armor again. A divine defender can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a suit of armor with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the divine defender loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first.

Allies in this aura (including the hospitaler) automatically stabilize if below 0 hit points and are immune to bleed damage. In addition, allies (including the paladin) that spend at least 1 full round inside the aura are healed an amount of damage equal to their total number of Hit Dice and may make a saving throw against any aff lictions they are suffering from, such as a curse, disease, or poison.

If the sacred servant increases her number of uses of lay on hands per day in this way, that choice is set for the rest of the day, and once used, these additional uses are not restored (even if the spirit is called again that day). The celestial spirit imparts no enhancements if the holy symbol is held by anyone other than the sacred servant, but resumes giving enhancements if returned to the sacred servant. A sacred servant can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a holy symbol with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the sacred servant loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the sacred servant takes a 1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.
Call Celestial Ally	KEY:Sacred Servant ~ Call Celestial Ally	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike		DESC:At 8th level, a sacred servant can call upon her deity for aid, in the form of a powerful servant.

At 12th level, this improves to planar ally and at 16th level, this improves to greater planar ally. The sacred servant's caster level for this effect is equal to her paladin level. This ability replaces aura of resolve.

	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Undead Scourge ~ Smite Evil
	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Undead Scourge ~ Aura of Life
	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Undead Scourge ~ Undead Annihilation

# Undead Scourge
Smite Evil			KEY:Undead Scourge ~ Smite Evil		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:This functions as the paladin ability of the same name, but the undead scourge does not deal 2 points of damage per level on the first successful attack against evil dragons and evil outsiders. She does deal 2 points of damage per level on all smite attacks made against evil undead creatures.
Aura of Life		KEY:Undead Scourge ~ Aura of Life		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 8th level, an undead scourge emits a 10-foot aura of life around her that weakens undead creatures. Undead in this aura take a 4 penalty on Will saves made to resist positive energy. In addition, undead in this aura do not regain hit points from channeled negative energy. This ability replaces aura of resolve.
Undead Annihilation	KEY:Undead Scourge ~ Undead Annihilation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 11th level, an undead scourge can expend one use of her smite evil ability as a standard action and make a single melee attack against an undead creature.

Undead with twice as many Hit Dice as the undead scourge are unaffected by this ability. If the attack misses, the smite evil is wasted without effect. This ability replaces aura of justice.

Warrior of the Holy Light	COST:0	CATEGORY:Archetype	TYPE:Archetype		SOURCEPAGE:p.118	DESC:Some paladins use their gifts to focus on the holy light that shines within their souls. With the gifts of purity and redemption, these paladins spend much of their lives helping others find the true path. Unleashing this power takes patience and comes at a steep price. Warriors of the holy light have the following class features.

	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Warrior of the Holy Light ~ Power of Faith
	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Warrior of the Holy Light ~ Shining Light

# Warrior of the Holy Light
Power of Faith	KEY:Warrior of the Holy Light ~ Power of Faith	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 4th level, a warrior of the holy light learns to use the power of her faith to bolster her defenses and aid her allies. This class feature replaces the paladin's spells class feature. A warrior of the holy light does not gain any spells or spellcasting abilities, does not have a caster level, and cannot use spell trigger or spell completion magic items. At 4th level, the warrior of the holy light gains one additional use of her lay on hands ability per day. She gains one additional use of lay on hands per day for every four levels she attains beyond 4th. She can call upon the power of her faith as a standard action. This causes a nimbus of light to emanate from the warrior of the holy light in a 30-foot radius. All allies in this area (including the warrior of the holy light) receive a +1 morale bonus to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear as long as they remain in the area of light. This power lasts for 1 minute. At 8th level, the nimbus of light heals the paladin and her allies, curing of them of 1d4 points of ability damage, as per the spell lesser restoration. A creature can only be healed in this way once per day. At 12th level, the nimbus of light is treated as daylight for the purposes of affecting creatures with sensitivity to light. In addition, the nimbus grants allies in the area resistance 10 to one type of energy, selected by the warrior of the holy light when this power is activated. At 16th level, the nimbus of light grants the warrior of the holy light and her allies protection from critical hits. There is a 25% chance that critical hits made against the warrior of the holy light and her allies in the area are instead treated as normal hits. This does not stack with other abilities that grant similar protection (such as light fortification). At 20th level, the nimbus of light increases in size out to a range of 60 feet. In addition, all of its bonuses increase. The morale bonus to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear increases to +2. The amount of ability damage healed increases to 2d4. The energy resistance increases to 20 against one energy type. Finally, protection against critical hits increases to 50%.
Shining Light	KEY:Warrior of the Holy Light ~ Shining Light	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 14th level, a warrior of the holy light can unleash a 30-foot burst of pure, white light as a standard action. Evil creatures within this burst take 1d6 points of damage for every two paladin levels and are blinded for 1 round. Evil dragons, evil outsiders, and evil undead are blinded for 1d4 rounds on a failed save. A Ref lex save halves this damage and negates the blindness. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the warrior of the holy light's level + the warrior of the holy light's Charisma modifier. Good creatures within this burst are healed 1d6 points of damage per two paladin levels and receive a +2 sacred bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 round. A warrior of the holy light can use this ability once per day at 14th level plus one additional time per day at 17th and 20th levels. This ability replaces aura of faith.

Animal Companion		KEY:Beast Master ~ Animal Companion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A beast master forms a close bond with an animal companion. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level  3. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on wild empathy and Handle Animal checks made regarding his animal companion. Unlike a normal ranger, a beast master's choice of animal companion is not limited to a subset of all possibile animal companion choiceshe may choose freely among all animal companion choices, just as a druid can. The beast master may have more than one animal companion, but he must divide up his effective druid level between his companions to determine the abilities of each companion. For example, a beast master with an effective druid level of 4 can have one 4th-level companion, two 2nd-level companions, or one 1st-level and one 3rd-level companion. Each time a beast master's effective druid level increases, he must decide how to allocate the increase among his animal companions (including the option of adding a new 1st-level companion). Once an effective druid level is allocated to a particular companion, it cannot be redistributed while that companion is in the ranger's service (he must release a companion or wait until a companion dies to allocate its levels to another companion). The share spells animal companion ability does not give the ranger the ability to cast a single spell so that it affects all of his animal companions. This ability replaces hunter's bond.
Improved Empathic Link	KEY:Beast Master ~ Improved Empathic Link	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The beast master gains an empathic link with all of his animal companions. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the ranger can also see through a companion's eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as he likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The ranger can only see through the eyes of one companion at a time, and is blinded while maintaining this connection. This replaces the 6th-level combat style feat.	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Ranger Bonus Feat|-1
Strong Bond			KEY:Beast Master ~ Strong Bond		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 12th level, the ranger strengthens his bond with his animal companions.

Infiltrator			COST:0	CATEGORY:Archetype	TYPE:Archetype	SOURCEPAGE:p.125	DESC:Some rangers study their favored enemies and learn their ways, applying this knowledge to their own abilities and using their foes' strengths against them.
