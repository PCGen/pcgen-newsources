attack roll. This ability replaces weapon training 4.

Penetrating Shot (Ex): At 19th level, when a crossbowman
confirms a critical hit with a crossbow, the bolt pierces

one attack. This ability replaces weapon mastery.

Polearm Master	p.106	DESC:The polearm master is schooled in the ancient wisdom
that enemies are best faced at the end of long striking pole,
lashing like a serpent before clumsy swords and axes can
even be brought to bear.

Pole Fighting (Ex): At 2nd level, as an immediate action,
a polearm master can shorten the grip on his spear or
polearm with reach and use it against adjacent targets.

weapon until he spends another immediate action to return
to the normal grip. The penalty is reduced by -1 for every
four levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.

Steadfast Pike (Ex): At 3rd level, a polearm master gains

barrier. This ability replaces weapon training 2.

Sweeping Fend (Ex): At 13th level, a polearm master
can use any spear or pole arm to make a bull rush or trip
maneuver, though he takes a -4 penalty to his CMB when
making such attempts. Weapons with the trip property
do not incur this penalty on trip maneuvers. This ability
replaces weapon training 3.

Step Aside (Ex): At 17th level, when a creature threatened
by a polearm master takes a 5-foot step into a square adjacent
to him, he can take a 5-foot step as an immediate action.
This 5-foot step must be subtracted from his movement
on the next turn. He also gains a +2 dodge bonus to his AC
against that opponent until the end of his next turn. This
ability replaces weapon training 4.

Polearm Parry (Ex): At 19th level, when an opponent
threatened by a polearm master makes a melee attack
against an ally, he may take an immediate action to grant
his ally a +2 shield bonus to AC and DR 5/- against that
attack. He may use this ability to protect himself, but only
if the attacking creature is not adjacent to him. This ability
replaces armor mastery.

Weapon Mastery (Ex): A polearm master must choose a
spear or polearm.

Roughrider	p.106	DESC:Roughriders study and practice the fine points of

action. This ability replaces armor training 2.

Two-Handed Fighter	p.108	DESC:Some fighters focus their efforts on finding the biggest,

a two-handed fighter may make a single melee attack with
a two-handed weapon at a -5 penalty. If the attack hits, it

hit is confirmed. This ability replaces armor mastery.

Two-Weapon Warrior	p.109	DESC:Trained under great masters who preached the simple
