# Exarch Abilities:
Spells			KEY:Spells ~ Exarch			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality			DESC:Exarchs cannot cast spells with the chaotic descriptor.
Inflexible Will		KEY:Inflexible Will ~ Exarch		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 1st level, an exarch gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against confusion and insanity effects and effects with the chaotic descriptor. This ability replaces monster lore.
Detect Chaos		KEY:Detect Chaos ~ Exarch		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		DESC:At will, an exarch can use detect chaos. This ability replaces detect alignment.
Fearsome Jurist		KEY:Fearsome Jurist ~ Exarch		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 5th level, an exarch can imbue one of her weapons with the jurist or menacing weapon special ability as a swift action, and may switch between these properties as a swift action. When using either special ability, her weapon's critical threat range doubles against chaotic creatures. This does not stack with keen edge, Improved Critical, or similar effects. This ability otherwise functions as and replaces bane.
Aura of Repetition	KEY:Aura of Repetition ~ Exarch	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 8th level, once per day while using her judgment, an exarch can project an aura of repetition, as the Toil subdomain power (Advanced Player's Guide 97). If the exarch takes Artifice (Toil) as her domain, the save DC of her aura increases by 2 but its duration does not increase. This ability replaces her second judgment.
Double Jeopardy		KEY:Double Jeopardy ~ Exarch		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 12th level, whenever an exarch uses her fearsome jurist ability, she may choose to affect two weapons, with one gaining the jurist weapon special ability and the other the menacing special ability as above. Both special abilities may be combined in a single weapon, whose critical threat range doubles. This does not stack with keen edge, Improved Critical, or similar effects. This ability replaces greater bane.
Aura of Reversion		KEY:Aura of Reversion ~ Exarch	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 16th level, while using her judgment, an exarch can project a 30-foot-radius emanation for a number of rounds per day equal to her inquisitor level. Any creature other than the exarch that is using a transmutation effect within this aura at the beginning of its turn becomes sickened, or sickened and nauseated if using a polymorph effect, including the change shape ability (Fortitude negates; DC 10 + 1/2 the exarch's level + her Wisdom modifier). Continuous effects from permanent magical items do not cause this effect. Within the aura, dispel checks against transmutation effects gain a +4 bonus. This ability cannot be used simultaneously with aura of repetition. This ability replaces her third judgment.

# Foehammer Abilities:
Sledgehammer		KEY:Sledgehammer ~ Foehammer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 3rd level, a foehammer wielding a hammer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on combat maneuver checks made to bull rush, overrun, sunder, or trip.

Hammer to the Ground	KEY:Hammer to the Ground ~ Foehammer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 7th level, when a foehammer succeeds at a bull rush combat maneuver, he can make a trip combat maneuver at the end of the bull rush. If he does not move with the target, the force of his blow may still trip his foe, but he takes a -5 penalty on the combat maneuver check to trip. At 15th level, any creature a foehammer successfully bull rushes is automatically knocked prone at the end of the bull rush. This ability replaces armor training 2 and 4.
Rhythmic Blows		KEY:Rhythmic Blows ~ Foehammer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 9th level, each time that a foehammer hits a target, he gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls against that target. This bonus stacks with each hit against that target, but lasts only until the end of the foehammer's turn. This ability replaces weapon training 2.
Piledriver			KEY:Piledriver ~ Foehammer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 11th level, as a standard action, a foehammer may make a single melee attack with a weapon from the hammer weapon training group. If the attack hits, he may make a bull rush or trip combat maneuver against the target of his attack as a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. This ability replaces armor training 3.
Ground Breaker		KEY:Ground Breaker ~ Foehammer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 13th level, as a full-round action, a foehammer may strike the ground with his hammer. If the attack deals more damage than the f loor's hardness, the space he occupies and all adjacent squares become difficult terrain. Creatures in those squares, except for the foehammer, are knocked prone (DC 15 Ref lex negates). This ability replaces weapon training 3.
Hammer Master		KEY:Hammer Master ~ Foehammer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 17th level, any combat feats a foehammer has learned with any weapon from the hammer weapon training group (e.g., Improved Critical, Weapon Focus) apply to all weapons from that group. This ability replaces weapon training 4.
Devastating Blow		KEY:Devastating Blow ~ Foehammer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 19th level, as a standard action, a foehammer may make a single melee attack with a weapon from the hammer weapon training group at a -5 penalty. If the attack hits, it is treated as a critical threat. Weapon special abilities that only activate on a critical hit do not activate if this critical hit is confirmed. This ability replaces armor mastery.
Weapon Mastery		KEY:Weapon Mastery ~ Foehammer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A foehammer must choose a weapon from the hammer group. [Needs to be implemented]

Artificer				KEY:Artificer ~ Forgemaster				CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A forgemaster gains only one domain, which must be the Artifice domain (not including subdomains). If she worships a deity, it must grant the Artifice domain.

These runes last 1 round per cleric level, but inscribing the same rune twice on an item increases this duration to 1 minute per level, three times to 10 minutes per level, and four times to 1 hour per level. Erase affects runes as magical writing. A forgemaster learns forgemaster's blessing at 1st level and may learn one additional rune at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter. Only one type of rune marked with an asterisk (*) may be placed on an item at any given time. This ability replaces channel energy.

# Stonelord Abilities:
Stonestrike		KEY:Stonestrike ~ Stonelord		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.16	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Once per day per paladin level, a stonelord can draw upon the power of the living rock.

By spending 2 uses of her stonestrike ability, she may ignore any cover less than total cover provided by stone or metal, and she ignores any AC bonus from stone or metal armor or shields as if wielding a brilliant energy weapon. A phase strike cannot damage constructs, objects, or creatures with the earth subtype, but unlike a brilliant energy weapon, it can harm undead. This ability replaces her 12th-level mercy.
Mobile Defense	KEY:Mobile Defense ~ Stonelord	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.17	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 18th level, a stonelord can make one 5-foot step per round while maintaining her defensive stance. This ability replaces her 18th-level mercy.

Experimental Gunsmith	KEY:Gunslinger Archetype ~ Experimental Gunsmith	CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.GunslingerArchetype.GunslingerFirearmTraining1.GunslingerFirearmTraining2.GunslingerFirearmTraining3.GunslingerFirearmTraining4	PRECLASS:1,Gunslinger=1	PRERACE:1,Gnome%	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,Gunslinger Archetype ~ Experimental Gunsmith],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.GunslingerFirearmTraining1,TYPE.GunslingerFirearmTraining2,TYPE.GunslingerFirearmTraining3,TYPE.GunslingerFirearmTraining4]	DESC:The Experimental Gunsmith is obsessed with creating the ultimate firearm, and is willing to take risks to work the kinks out of her design.	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Experimental Firearm ~ Experimental Gunsmith|PRECLASS:1,Gunslinger=1	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Innovations ~ Experimental Gunsmith|PRECLASS:1,Gunslinger=1	COST:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.34

###Block: Gunslinger Archetype Abilities -------------------------
#Experimental Gunsmith
Experimental Firearm	KEY:Experimental Firearm ~ Experimental Gunsmith	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, an Experimental Gunsmith begins play with an experimental firearm. This acts as the gunslinger's gunsmith ability, but the firearm the Experimental Gunsmith begins with has one innovation (see below). Further, the Experimental Gunsmith is treated as having the Gunsmithing feat, but only in regard to his beginning firearm (or the construction of a replacement firearm of the same design, if the original is lost). This ability otherwise works like the standard gunslinger's gunsmith and Gunsmithing abilities and replaces those abilities.	SOURCEPAGE:p.34
Innovations			KEY:Innovations ~ Experimental Gunsmith			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:An Experimental Gunsmith starts play with one innovation she can make to her experimental firearms, selected from the list below. This innovation is a radical change to the typical design of a firearm, and comes with both additional benefits and noteworthy drawbacks. The Experimental Gunsmith can maintain only one experimental firearm modified with one or more innovations, as it requires constant adjustments and much of her time is spent maintaining the weapon. If the Experimental Gunsmith takes the Gunsmithing feat, she can create other firearms using a single innovation she knows (or add one innovation to an existing firearm), though such weapons become unreliable over time. The misfire value of such weapons increases by 1 for each week after its creation, although the Experimental Gunsmith can return the misfire rate to normal by spending 1 day maintaining the weapon and spending 50 gp in raw materials. For the purposes of crafting such firearms, each innovation is treated as the masterwork weapon quality (with a value of 300 gp).	SOURCEPAGE:p.34	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Experimental Gunsmith Innovation|(classlevel("Gunslinger")+3)/4

#Experimental Gunsmith - Innovations
Expanded Capacity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ExperimentalGunsmithInnovation	DESC:The Experimental Gunsmith increases her firearm's capacity by one (generally by adding another barrel, depending on the weapon's design). She also increases its weight by 50%%. Because of the complexity of increasing its capacity, her weapon is more prone to misfire, and its misfire value increases by 1 (this is in addition to any misfire increase if the weapon is made with the Gunsmithing feat).
Expanded Chamber	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ExperimentalGunsmithInnovation	DESC:The Experimental Gunsmith's firearm has a much larger than normal chamber for black powder, allowing her to use 2 doses of powder with each shot. The weapon grants a +1 circumstance bonus on damage rolls. However, when the weapon misfires, it causes a flashburn. This is the same as the weapon exploding (dealing damage from a corner of the Experimental Gunsmith's square), except the weapon is not automatically destroyed. If a broken weapon misfires, it is destroyed as normal.
Grapple Launcher	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ExperimentalGunsmithInnovation	DESC:The Experimental Gunsmith's firearm includes a special set of rails that allows her to slide a grappling hook over the barrel and fire it as a full-round action. The grappling hook anchors into anything she successfully hits with an attack roll, and the DC of the Strength check required to pull the grappling hook loose is equal to her attack roll to lodge it in place. A Disable Device check can remove it with a +5 bonus on the check, and a creature struck by the hook can escape it with a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check with a +5 bonus on the check. The firearm is powerful enough to fire a hook trailing up to 100 feet of rope, but throws off the balance of the Experimental Gunsmith's firearm, reducing its range increment by 50%%.
Recoilless		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ExperimentalGunsmithInnovation	DESC:The Experimental Gunsmith's firearm includes a series of gears, springs, and pistons designed to reduce its recoil and thus improve accuracy. The range increment of the weapon increases by 10 feet. However, the system is fragile, and easily damaged. Anytime the weapon misfires, this system becomes broken and does not function until the Experimental Gunsmith spends 1 hour repairing it.
Vial Launcher	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ExperimentalGunsmithInnovation	DESC:The Experimental Gunsmith adds a special tube onto her firearm that can hold 1 vial of alchemical material, such as alchemist's fire, a tanglefoot bag, or a thunderstone. A special trigger allows her to channel the force of black powder into this tube to launch the vial as a ranged attack with half the range increment of her firearm. The Experimental Gunsmith can take this action in place of any single ranged attack, and may use the same attack bonus that she can apply to the firearm. If the alchemical substance has a save DC, it becomes 10 + 1/2 her Experimental Gunsmith level + her Wisdom modifier when she launches the vial from her firearm. This increase only applies to the initial saving throw. If additional saving throws are called for, they are resolved as normal. Reloading the tube is a time-consuming process and requires two full-round actions. If the weapon misfires while loaded with an alchemical substance, it detonates with the Experimental Gunsmith (and the firearm) as the target.
