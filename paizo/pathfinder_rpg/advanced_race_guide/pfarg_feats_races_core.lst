Blood Vengeance
	TYPE:General
	PRERACE=1,Orc,Half-Orc
	!PREALIGN:LG,LN,LE
	DESC:Seeing an ally fall in combat fills you with a raging and murderous fury.
	BENEFIT:Whenever one of your allies is reduced to negative hit points or killed, you may enter a state similar to but less powerful than a barbarian's rage as a free action on your next turn. If you have the rage class feature and are already raging, your morale bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by +2 for the duration of your rage. If you do not have the rage class feature, or you have no more rage rounds left, this weaker rage gives you all the benefits and penalties of a barbarian's rage, except your morale bonus to Strength and Constitution is only +2.

Ferocious Resolve
	TYPE:General

	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Orc Ferocity
	PRESTAT:1,CON=13
	DESC:Your orc heritage allows you to fight on.
	BENEFIT:You gain the ferocity universal monster ability, allowing you to continue fighting at negative hit points.

	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Ferocity,Rage
	DESC:You spit in the face of death.
	BENEFIT:Once per day when raging, if you are hit by an attack that would deal enough hit points of damage to kill you (negative hit points equal to your Constitution score), as an immediate action you may expend 1 or more rounds of rage to negate some of this damage and keep yourself alive. Each round of rage you spend reduces the attack's damage by 1 point, but cannot reduce the damage taken below 1 hit point. For example, if you are raging, have a raging Constitution score of 18, are currently at 2 hit points, and take 20 hit points of damage from a hit (which is enough to bring you to �18 hit points, thereby killing you), you may spend 1 round of rage to reduce the damage by 1 hit point (leaving you perilously close to death at �17 hit points); if you spend 17 rounds of rage, you reduce the damage to 1 (the minimum), leaving you with 1 hit point. &nl; [Note] If this damage still makes you fall unconscious, your rage ends just like it normally would, lowering your Constitution to its normal value and reducing your hit point total as normal. Therefore, it is possible to use this feat to prevent yourself from instantly dying, yet you still die because your negative hit points exceed your normal Constitution score�take your normal Constitution into account when deciding how many rounds of rage to spend with this feat.

Gore Fiend
	TYPE:General
	PRERACE=1,Orc,Half-Orc

Sympathetic Rage 
	TYPE:Combat

	DESC:Seeing an ally rage fills you with your own fury.
	BENEFIT:Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who is raging, you may choose to enter a similar but less powerful rage as a free action on your turn. This weaker rage gives you all the benefits and penalties of a barbarian's rage, except your morale bonus to Strength and Constitution is only +2. There is no limit to how long you can rage, as long as you remain adjacent to a raging ally (for example, you could take a 5-foot step away from one raging ally toward another raging ally and maintain your rage). As with a barbarian's rage, when this weaker rage ends, you are fatigued. You cannot use this feat if you are fatigued.

Tenacious Survivor
	TYPE:General
	PRERACE=1,Orc,Half-Orc
	PREFEAT:2,Diehard,Endurance
	PRESTAT:1,CON=13
	DESC:Your spirit lingers long after any other's would have passed on.
	BENEFIT:When you are killed by hit point damage, your soul lingers in your body for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution bonus. You are still dead, but a creature can make a DC 10 Heal check as a standard action to realize that you can still be saved. You can be healed by magic as if you were alive.
