fails a save against an effect that would kill it instantly,
it rises from death 3 rounds later with 1 hit point if no

kami may emerge at any point within that location.
	DESC:%nl; Ward (Su) A kami has a specific ward-a creature with a
2 or lower Intelligence (usually an animal or vermin), a
plant (not a plant creature), an object, or a location	DESC:%nl; The
type of ward is listed in parentheses in the kami's stat
block	DESC:%nl; Several of a kami's abilities function only when
it is either merged with its ward or within 120 feet of it.
If a kami's ward is portable and travels with the kami to
another plane, the kami does not gain the extraplanar
subtype on that other plane as long as its ward remains
within 120 feet	DESC:%nl; If a ward is destroyed while a kami
is merged with it, the kami dies (no save)	DESC:%nl; If a ward is

fear effect	DESC:%nl; The save DC is Charisma-based.

spell, this ability only allows transformation into Small
plants of the same type of growth the leshy is related to.

specimen of that particular plant	DESC:%nl; A leshy can assume
plant form or revert to its true form as a swift action.

subject to a continual speak with plants spell, but only
with species they are related to.

of fertile energies	DESC:%nl; All plant creatures within 30 feet of
a slain leshy heal 1d8 points of damage plus 1 point per
HD of the slain leshy, and plant life of the same type
as the leshy itself quickly infests the area	DESC:%nl; If the terrain
can support this type of plant, the undergrowth is dense
enough to make the region into difficult terrain for 24
hours, after which the plant life diminishes to a normal
level; otherwise, the plant life has no significant effect
on movement and withers and dies within an hour.
	DESC:%nl; Except where otherwise noted, all leshys speak Druidic
and Sylvan.

the spell of the same name	DESC:%nl; This effect functions at CL
18th	DESC:%nl; A rakshasa can suppress or resume this ability as

rakshasa's HD + the rakshasa's Charisma modifier.
	DESC:%nl; Enhanced Defenses (Ex) All rakshasas have DR that can

rodents called ratfolk and creatures related to ratfolk.

307
Appendices
A swarm has the characteristics of its type, except as noted
here	DESC:%nl; A swarm has a single pool of Hit Dice and hit points,
a single initiative modifier, a single speed, and a single
Armor Class	DESC:%nl; A swarm makes saving throws as a single
creature	DESC:%nl; A single swarm occupies a square (if it is made up
of non-f lying creatures) or a cube (if it is made up of f lying
creatures) 10 feet on a side, but its reach is 0 feet, like its
component creatures	DESC:%nl; In order to attack, it moves into an
opponent's space, which provokes an attack of opportunity.
A swarm can occupy the same space as a creature of any size,
since it crawls all over its prey	DESC:%nl; A swarm can move through
squares occupied by enemies and vice versa without
impediment, although the swarm provokes an attack of
opportunity if it does so	DESC:%nl; A swarm can move through cracks
or holes large enough for its component creatures.
A swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 non-f lying
creatures or 1,000 f lying creatures	DESC:%nl; A swarm of Diminutive
creatures consists of 1,500 non-f lying creatures or 5,000
f lying creatures	DESC:%nl; A swarm of Fine creatures consists of
10,000 creatures, whether they are f lying or not	DESC:%nl; Swarms
of non-f lying creatures include many more creatures
than could normally fit in a 10-foot square based on their
normal space, because creatures in a swarm are packed
tightly together and generally crawl over each other and
their prey when moving or attacking	DESC:%nl; Larger swarms
are represented by multiples of single swarms	DESC:%nl; The area
occupied by a large swarm is completely shapeable, though
the swarm usually remains in contiguous squares.
Swarm Traits	DESC:A swarm has no clear front or back and no
discernible anatomy, so it is not subject to critical hits or
f lanking	DESC:%nl; A swarm made up of Tiny creatures takes half
damage from slashing and piercing weapons	DESC:%nl; A swarm
composed of Fine or Diminutive creatures is immune
to all weapon damage	DESC:%nl; Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points
or less causes it to break up, though damage taken until
that point does not degrade its ability to attack or resist
attack	DESC:%nl; Swarms are never staggered or reduced to a dying
state by damage	DESC:%nl; Also, they cannot be tripped, grappled,
or bull rushed, and they cannot grapple an opponent.
A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets
a specific number of creatures (including single-target
spells such as disintegrate), with the exception of mindaffecting
effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects,
patterns, and phantasms) if the swarm has an Intelligence
score and a hive mind	DESC:%nl; A swarm takes half again as much
damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area,
such as splash weapons and many evocation spells.
Swarms made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are
susceptible to high winds, such as those created by a gust
of wind spell	DESC:%nl; For the purpose of determining the effects
of wind on a swarm, treat the swarm as a creature of the
same size as its constituent creatures	DESC:%nl; A swarm rendered
unconscious by means of nonlethal damage becomes
disorganized and dispersed, and does not reform until
its hit points exceed its nonlethal damage.
Swarm Attacks	DESC:Creatures with the swarm subtype don't
make standard melee attacks	DESC:%nl; Instead, they deal automatic
damage to any creature whose space they occupy at the
end of their move, with no attack roll needed	DESC:%nl; Swarm
attacks are not subject to a miss chance for concealment
or cover	DESC:%nl; A swarm's stat block has "swarm" in the Melee
entries, with no attack bonus given.
A swarm's attacks are nonmagical, unless the swarm's
description states otherwise	DESC:%nl; Damage reduction sufficient
to reduce a swarm attack's damage to 0, being incorporeal,
or other special abilities usually give a creature immunity
(or at least resistance) to damage from a swarm	DESC:%nl; Some
swarms also have acid, blood drain, poison, or other
special attacks in addition to normal damage.
Swarms do not threaten creatures, and do not make
attacks of opportunity with their swarm attacks.
However, they distract foes whose squares they occupy,
as described below.
Swarms possess the distraction universal monster rule.
Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of
a swarm requires a caster level check (DC 20 + spell level).
Using skills that involve patience and concentration
requires a DC 20 Will save.

the Swim skill as a class skill.
