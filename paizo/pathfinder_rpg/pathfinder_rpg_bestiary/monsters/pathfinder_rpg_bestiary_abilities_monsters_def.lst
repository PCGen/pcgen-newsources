A successful hold does not deal any extra damage unless you also have the constrict special attack. If you do not constrict, each successful grapple check you make during successive rounds automatically deals the damage indicated for the attack that established the hold.

The vortex form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if it enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the vortex if it touches or enters the vortex, or if the vortex moves into or through a creature's space.

Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the vortex might take damage when caught in the vortex (generally damage equal the elementals slam attack). An affected creature must succeed on a Reflex save (DC %2) when it comes into contact with the vortex or take damage as if it were hit by the elemental's slam attack. It must also succeed on a second Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the vortex, automatically taking the indicated damage each round. Creatures trapped in the vortex cannot move except to go where the vortex carries them or to escape the vortex. Trapped creatures can otherwise act normally, but must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the vortex take a -4 penalty to Dexterity and a -2 penalty on attack rolls. The vortex can have only as many creatures trapped inside at one time as will fit inside the vortex's volume. The vortex can eject any carried creatures whenever you wish as a free action, depositing them in the elementas's space.

The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud of debris must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.|VortexHeight|VortexDC
