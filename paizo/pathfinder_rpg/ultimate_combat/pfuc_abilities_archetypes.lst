# Spellslinger Abilities
Arcane Gun		KEY:Arcane Gun ~ Spellslinger			CATEGORY:Special Ability	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Spellslinger Gun Choice|1
Arcane Gun		KEY:Arcane Gun ~ Display			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	CHOOSE:STRING|One Gun|Two Guns	MULT:YES	STACK:NO	AUTO:FEAT|Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Firearms)	DESC:The spellslinger gains the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearms) feat, and one or two of his firearms can be arcane guns. Arcane guns are normal one-handed or two-handed firearms in the hands of others, as they were normal firearms before the spellslinger imbued them with magic. In a spellslinger's hands, they both fire projectiles (bullets and pellets) and cast magic. At 1st level, the spellslinger decides whether he wants to have one or two arcane guns at a time. If the spellslinger chooses to have only one arcane gun at a time, spells fired Classes through the arcane gun that require an attack roll have a x3 critical hit multiplier.&nl; A spellslinger can cast any ranged touch attack, cone, line, or ray spells through his arcane gun. When he casts through the arcane gun, the gun's enhancement bonus (if any) is a bonus to the spell's attack rolls or to the spell's saving throw DCs. Yet there are dangers inherent to this method. If any of the spells' attack rolls result in a natural 1 (a misfire), or a natural 20 is rolled on any saving throw made against the spell by a target (an overload), the arcane gun gains the broken condition. If the arcane gun already has the broken condition, the gun explodes. When a gun explodes, it lets loose a blast of force, or if the spell has the acid, cold, electricity, or sonic descriptor, it deals that type of energy damage instead. In the case of spells with multiple descriptors, roll randomly among the descriptors to determine the type of damage dealt by the blast. The blast is centered on a single intersection within the spellslinger's space (spellslinger's choice) and deals 1d6 points of the appropriate energy damage or force damage per level of the spell cast. Any creature within the blast other than the spellslinger can make a Reflex saving throw to halve the damage. The Reflex save DC is calculated using the spell level of the spell being sacrificed.&nl; A spellslinger can attune his arcane guns at the start of each day. That attunement lasts until the spellslinger attunes to a new gun, even if a formally attuned gun is destroyed.&nl;Spellslinger Choice %LIST.&nl; This ability replaces arcane bond.
Gunsmith		KEY:Gunsmith ~ Spellslinger			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack	DESC:The spellslinger gains the Gunsmithing feat and a battered gun that is identical to the gun a Gunslinger (see page 9) gains at first level. If the spellslinger chooses the ability to attune two arcane guns, he still only starts out with one gun. Like a Gunslinger, a spellslinger can use the Gunsmithing feat to restore his battered gun.&nl; This ability replaces Scribe Scroll.
Mage Bullets	KEY:Mage Bullets ~ Spellslinger		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	DESC:A spellslinger is adept at transferring spell energy into his arcane gun attacks. As a swift action, he can sacrifice a spell and transform that energy into a weapon bonus equal to the level of the spell sacrificed on a single barrel of his firearm. With that weapon bonus the spellslinger can apply any of the following to his arcane bond: enhancement bonuses (up to +5) and dancing, defending, distance, flaming, flaming burst, frost, ghost touch, icy burst, merciful, seeking, shock, shocking burst, spell storing, thundering, vicious, and wounding. An arcane gun gains no benefit from having two of the same weapon special abilities on the same barrel. The effect of the mage bullets ability lasts for a number of minutes equal to the level of the spell sacrificed, or until this ability is used again to assign the barrel different enhancements.&nl; This ability replaces cantrips, but the spellslinger gains the detect magic and read magic cantrips and places them in his spellbook. He can cast either of these as 1st-level spells.	SPELLKNOWN:CLASS|Wizard=1|Detect Magic,Read Magic
School of the Gun	KEY:School of the Gun ~ Spellslinger	CATEGORY:Special Ability	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Spellslinger Opposition School Choice|4
School of the Gun	KEY:School of the Gun ~ Display		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack	CHOOSE:SCHOOLS|ALL	MULT:YES	STACK:NO	DESC:The rigor and care required by arcane guns is so great that a spellslinger forsakes four schools of magic. These opposition schools are chosen at 1st level and cannot be changed later. A spellslinger who prepares a spell from his opposition school must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell. In addition, the spellslinger takes a -4 penalty on any skill checks made when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of his opposition schools as a prerequisite.&nl; Chosen Opposition Schools, %LIST.&nl; This ability replaces arcane school.
