Once per day, when the witch hunter comes into contact with or is exposed to a spell effect or a magic item, she can spend a full-round action to examine the spell effect or magic item, and then gains the effect of a locate creature spell (Core Rulebook 305). She can do this even if the spell effect was instantaneous, but must start her examination within 1 round after she experienced the spell's effect. Instead of locating a known creature, the witch hunter locates the caster of the spell effect or magic item she examined. Doing so does not allow the witch hunter to gain any intelligence about the spellcaster other than its location. This ability replaces track.						SOURCEPAGE:p.53

Bastion of Good			KEY:Bastion of Good ~ SACRED SHIELD				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Archetype.PaladinArchetype		DESC:At 1st level, a sacred shield can call upon the powers of good to defend her and her allies against evil. This ability functions as smite evil, except that the paladin gains no benefit on attack or damage rolls against her target. Instead, any attacks the target makes against allies within 10 feet of the paladin deal half damage. Attacks against the paladin deal full damage, but the paladin gains a deflection bonus to her AC equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) against attacks made by the target of the smite. This bonus increases by +1 for every four paladin levels (to a maximum of +6 at 20th level). As with smite evil, if the paladin targets a creature that is not evil, her bastion of good ability is wasted with no effect. Feats, abilities, and the like that increase a paladin's number of uses of smite evil per day increase a sacred shield's uses of bastion of good per day. This ability replaces smite evil.																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.65
Holy Shield				KEY:Holy Shield ~ SACRED SHIELD				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Archetype.PaladinArchetype		DESC:At 4th level, a sacred shield can channel her faith into her shield, protecting any nearby allies. All allies adjacent to the paladin gain a shield bonus equal to the sacred shield's own shield bonus, including any increase from the shield's enhancement bonus. This bonus does not stack with any existing shield bonuses. The paladin herself radiates light as a light spell while the shielding is active. At 11th level, this protection expands to cover any allies within 10 feet and the radiance increases to the effects of a daylight spell. At 20th level, any allies within 20 feet are protected. Using this ability consumes two uses of the sacred shield's lay on hands ability, and the effects last for 3 rounds plus a number of rounds equal to her Charisma bonus (if any). This ability replaces channel positive energy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.65
Divine Bond				KEY:Divine Bond ~ SACRED SHIELD				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Archetype.PaladinArchetype		DESC:At 5th level, instead of forming a divine bond with her weapon or a mount, a sacred shield forms a bond with her shield. As a standard action, a sacred shield can enhance her shield by calling on the aid of a celestial spirit. This bond lasts for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the shield to shed light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants the shield a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the shield gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the shield, stacking with existing enhancement bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following armor special abilities - arrow deflection, bashing, blinding, fortification (any), reflecting, and spell resistance (any). The reflecting enhancement may be used once each time the sacred shield makes use of her divine bond. Adding these armor special abilities consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-4 on page 485 of the Core Rulebook). These bonuses are added to any properties the shield already has, but duplicate special abilities do not grant any extra benefit. If the shield is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other special abilities can be added. The bonus and special abilities granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The celestial spirit imparts no bonuses if the shield is used by anyone other than the sacred shield, but it resumes giving bonuses if the sacred shield resumes using the shield. A sacred shield can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a maximum of four times per day at 17th level. If a shield with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the sacred shield loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this period, the sacred shield takes a -1 penalty to her armor class and on saving throws.	SOURCEPAGE:p.65
Improved Bastion			KEY:Improved Bastion ~ SACRED SHIELD			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archetype.PaladinArchetype					DESC:At 11th level, the radius of a sacred shield's bastion of good ability increases to 20 feet.

Advantageous Terrain	KEY:Advantageous Terrain ~ BATTLE SCOUT	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.RangerArchetype	DESC:At 5th level, when a battle scout is within one of his favorite terrains, he can spend up to 3 consecutive rounds studying an area of terrain to gain the benefits below. Each round of studying terrain is a standard action. During the first round of studying terrain, the battle scout designates a 60-foot-radius-burst area from a single square within line of sight. Depending on how many rounds the battle scout spends studying the area, he or his allies gain the following benefits for 10 minutes per ranger level he possesses. (For example, if he spends 2 rounds, he or his allies gain the first two benefits.) 1st Round - Allies within line of sight and that can hear the battle scout gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks while within the advantageous terrain area. 2nd Round - Allies within line of sight and that can hear the battle scout gain a +2 on Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks while within the advantageous terrain area. 3rd Round - The battle scout's movement is not hampered by difficult terrain while within the advantageous terrain area.

This ability replaces the ranger's third favorite enemy.

Superior Tactics		KEY:Superior Tactics ~ BATTLE SCOUT		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.RangerArchetype	DESC:At 15th level, once per day, after a battle scout and his allies roll initiative, the battle scout can arrange his and his allies' initiative rolls any way he wishes. If he has already taken 3 rounds to scout out the terrain with his advantageous terrain ability and both he and his allies are within the effect area, they gain a +2 bonus to initiative checks.

FALCONER			KEY:Ranger Archetype ~ FALCONER		CATEGORY:Archetype	COST:0	TYPE:Archetype.RangerArchetype					DESC:Rangers have always enjoyed a special bond with a specific animal, but the falconer takes this bond to a deeper level.

Feathered Companion	KEY:Feathered Companion ~ FALCONER		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.RangerArchetype	DESC:At 1st level, a falconer earns the trust and companionship of a bird of prey. The bird can be of any type of large hunting or scavenging bird (even a vulture). This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature), but the falconer must take the bird animal companion, and that companion has only half the normal hit points. The falconer cannot teach the bird of prey the work trick, but can teach it either the roam or distract trick for free. Whichever trick the falconer does not pick then can be picked as a trick later. Roam (DC 15) - The falconer can let his animal companion loose to roam and forage. He must let it roam for no more than a week. When the falconer lets it roam, it agrees to return to the place he let it loose within the time period he designates. Distract (DC 20; bird only) - The animal companion flutters wildly around any enemy it would normally attack with the attack trick. It makes an attack roll against that enemy. On a hit, the enemy is shaken. This ability replaces wild empathy.																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.67
Hunter's Bond		KEY:Hunter's Bond ~ FALCONER			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.RangerArchetype	DESC:At 4th level, a falconer must select an animal companion when he gains hunter's bond.

Swoop for the Kill	KEY:Swoop for the Kill ~ FALCONER		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.RangerArchetype	DESC:At 6th level, when outdoors, a falconer can direct his feathered companion to strike an enemy from high above. His feathered companion gains the following trick as a bonus trick. Swooping Charge (DC 20; bird) - The falconer's bird companion flies up and then swoops down into a charge. To perform this trick, the companion must be able to fly, and it must be outdoors or someplace with enough room for the bird to fly great distances in (a grand cathedral may have enough room, but dungeons usually do not). It spends a full-round action flying to a high vantage point, and on the next round makes a charge attack upon an enemy the falconer designates. If that charge attack hits, the bird deals 2d4 points of damage instead of 1d4 with its bite and gains a ?4 critical modifier when making the attack. If the bird hits, the target is staggered for 1 round. This ability replaces the combat style feat the ranger gains at 6th level.

TROPHY HUNTER		KEY:Ranger Archetype ~ TROPHY HUNTER	CATEGORY:Archetype	COST:0	TYPE:Archetype.RangerArchetype					DESC:Some rangers have taken up the mysteries of black powder in order to become big game hunters. Finding firearms useful for taking down large and dangerous prey, they enter the fight with the crack of black powder fire, often ranging far and wide in their safaris and searches for ever-more-dangerous denizens of the wild to track, study, appreciate-and kill. While this might strike some as going against the ranger's usual respect for nature and the creatures of the wild, trophy hunters understand that they are just more pieces in nature's grand puzzle, and that the laws of the jungle-the right to kill and feed on those weaker than you, and the need to establish dominance through cunning and bloodshed-are both their rights and their duty as the current top of the food chain.

Improved Tracking		KEY:Improved Tracking ~ TROPHY HUNTER	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.RangerArchetype	DESC:At 1st level, a trophy hunter gains a +2 bonus on Survival skill checks when following or identifying tracks. When he tracks, he can also attempt a Knowledge (nature) check at DC 15. On a success, the trophy hunter can discern the type and condition of any animals or magical beasts he tracks. By studying their tracks, the trophy hunter is able to identify a rough approximation of their health, maneuverability, and their general behavior as compared to the norm. This ability replaces wild empathy.																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.67
Firearm Style		KEY:Firearm Style ~ TROPHY HUNTER		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archetype.RangerArchetype					DESC:At 2nd level, a trophy hunter gains the Amateur Gunslinger feat, and can use any 1st-level gunslinger deed (page 10). At every four levels thereafter, the trophy hunter can take a grit feat or select a gunslinger deed of his level or lower, ranger's choice. This ability replaces combat feat style.																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.68
Hunter's Aim		KEY:Hunter's Aim ~ TROPHY HUNTER		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.RangerArchetype	DESC:At 4th level, a trophy hunter gains a specific understanding of the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of his favored enemies, and his careful study of these enemies reveals the best way to hurt them. When the trophy hunter makes a firearm attack against a favored enemy, he can target touch AC in the first two range increments of his firearm. This ability stacks with other effects that increase the range increments to target touch AC, adding one range increment to the effect. This ability replaces hunter's bond.																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.68

WARDEN			KEY:Ranger Archetype ~ WARDEN			CATEGORY:Archetype	COST:0	TYPE:Archetype.RangerArchetype					DESC:All rangers have a bond with the wilderness, but the warden may have the strongest. This protector sits guard in the middle of the wilderness, keeping a lookout for any dangers that might spill from the deeper wilderness beyond, and protecting civilization from the savagery of nature-and vice versa. His long weeks, months, and sometimes years of isolation cause him to "hear" what the land is saying. Not all are crazy.
