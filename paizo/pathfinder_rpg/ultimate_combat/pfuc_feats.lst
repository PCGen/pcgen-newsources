BENEFIT:As a swift action, you can apply one dose of contact or injury poison to two body parts that you use for unarmed strikes. You must still protect yourself against exposure to contact poisons you apply in this way. &nl; [Normal] Applying poison to a weapon or single piece of ammunition is a standard action.	SOURCEPAGE:p.89
Wave Strike	TYPE:Combat	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Weapon Expertise ~ Samurai],[PREFEAT:1,Quick Draw]	PRESKILL:1,Bluff=1	DESC:You present a serene facade until you unsheathe your weapon and strike in one fluid motion.	BENEFIT:If on your first turn of combat you draw a melee weapon to attack an opponent within your reach, you can spend a swift action to make a Bluff check to feint against that opponent.	SOURCEPAGE:p.123
Whip Mastery	TYPE:Combat	PREFEAT:1,Weapon Focus (whip)	PREATT:2	DESC:Your superior expertise with this weapon does not provoke attacks of opportunity from your enemies.	BENEFIT:You no longer provoke attacks of opportunity when attacking with a whip. You can deal lethal damage with a whip, although you can still deal nonlethal damage when you want. Further, you can deal damage with a whip despite a creature's armor bonus or natural armor bonus. &nl; [Normal] Attacking with a whip provokes attacks of opportunity as if you used a ranged weapon. A whip deals no damage to a creature that has an armor bonus of +1 or natural armor bonus of +3.	SOURCEPAGE:p.123
Improved Whip Mastery	TYPE:Combat	PREFEAT:2,Weapon Focus (whip),Whip Mastery	PREATT:5	DESC:You are able to entangle opponents with the coils of your whip.	BENEFIT:While wielding a whip, you threaten the area of your natural reach plus 5 feet. You can also use a whip to grasp an unattended Small or Tiny object within your whip's reach and pull that object into your square. To do so, you must hit AC 10 with a melee touch attack. Further, you can use the whip to grasp onto an object within your whip's reach, using 5 feet of your whip as if it were a grappling hook, allowing you to use the rest of your whip to swing on like a rope. As a free action, you can release the object your whip is grasping, but you cannot use the whip to attack while the whip is grasping an object.	SOURCEPAGE:p.106
Greater Whip Mastery	TYPE:Combat	PREFEAT:3,Improved Whip Mastery,Weapon Focus (whip),Whip Mastery	PREATT:8	DESC:You can use a whip to make combat maneuvers with ease.	BENEFIT:You are so quick with your whip that you never drop it due to a failed disarm or trip combat maneuver attempt. Further, you gain the ability to grapple using your whip. To do so, use the normal grapple rules with the following changes. &nl;Attack - You cannot use your whip to attack while you are using it to grapple an opponent. &nl;Damage - When dealing damage to your grappled opponent, you deal your whip's weapon damage rather than your unarmed strike damage. &nl;Free Hands - You take no penalty on your combat maneuver check for having fewer than two hands free when you use your whip to grapple. &nl;Reach - Rather than pulling your grappled opponent adjacent to you when you successfully grapple and when you move the grapple, you must keep him within your whip's reach minus his own reach to maintain the grapple. If the difference in reach is less than 0, such as is the case for a Medium whip wielder and a Gargantuan creature, you cannot grapple that opponent with your whip. If you have to pull a creature adjacent to you to grapple it with your whip, you still provoke an attack of opportunity from that opponent unless you have the Improved Grapple feat. &nl;Tie Up - While adjacent to your opponent, you can attempt to use your whip to tie him up. If you do so to an opponent you have grappled rather than pinned, you take only a -5 penalty on the combat maneuver check rather than the normal -10.	SOURCEPAGE:p.103
