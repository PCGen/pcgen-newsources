Like any other arcane spellcaster, a magus wearing medium armor, heavy armor, or a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component.

This arcane pool has %1 points. The pool refreshes once per day when you prepare your spells. You can expend 1 point from your arcane pool as a swift action to grant any weapon you are holding a +%2 enhancement bonus for 1 minute. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon enhancement to a maximum of +5. Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves.|MagusArcanePool|MagusArcanePoolBonus	DESC:These bonuses can be also used to add any of the following weapon properties: Dancing, Flaming, Flaming Burst, Frost, Icy Burst, Keen, Shock, Shocking Burst, Speed, or Vorpal. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's base price modifier. These properties are added to any the weapon already has, but duplicates do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. These bonuses and properties are decided when the arcane pool point is spent and cannot be changed until the next time you use this ability. These bonuses do not function if the weapon is wielded by anyone other than you. You can only enhance one weapon in this way at one time. If you use this ability again, the first use immediately ends.|PREVARGTEQ:MagusArcanePoolLVL,5																																																												BONUS:VAR|MagusArcanePool|max(MagusArcanePoolLVL/2,1)+INT	BONUS:VAR|MagusArcanePoolBonus|min(1+((MagusArcanePoolLVL-1)/4),5)	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	ASPECT:CheckCount|%1|MagusArcanePool	ASPECT:CheckType|Uses per Day	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(%1/day)|MagusArcanePool
Cantrips			KEY:Cantrips ~ Magus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																				DESC:You can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.

Spell Combat		KEY:Spell Combat Output			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																		DESC:You can cast spells and wield your weapons at the same time. This functions much like two-weapon fighting, but the offhand weapon is a spell that is being cast. To use this ability, you must have one hand free (even if the spell being cast does not have somatic components), while wielding a light or one-handed melee weapon in the other hand. As a full-round action, you can make all of your attacks with ypur melee weapon at a -2 penalty and can also cast any spell from the magus spell list with a casting time of 1 standard action  (any attack roll made as part of this spell also takes this penalty). If you cast this spell defensively, you can decide to take an additional penalty on your attack rolls, up to your Intelligence bonus, and add the same amount as a circumstance bonus on your concentration check. If the check fails, the spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty. You can choose to cast the spell first or make the weapon attacks first, but if you have more than one attack, you cannot cast the spell between weapon attacks.																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.10
Spellstrike			KEY:Spellstrike ~ Magus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																		DESC:Whenever you cast a spell with a range of "touch" from the magus spell list, you can deliver the spell through any weapon you are wielding as part of a melee attack. Instead of the free melee touch attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, a magus can make one free melee attack with his weapon (at his highest base attack bonus) as part of casting this spell. If successful, this melee attack deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. If you make this attack in concert with spell combat, this melee attack takes all the penalties accrued by spell combat melee attacks. This attack uses the weapon's critical range (20, 19-20, or 18-20 and modified by the keen weapon property or similar effects), but the spell effect only deals x2 damage on a successful critical hit, while the weapon damage uses its own critical modifier.

SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Knowledge Pool		KEY:Knowledge Pool ~ Magus		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:When you prepare your magus spells, you can decide to expend 1 or more points from your arcane pool, up to your Intelligence bonus. For each point you expend, you can treat any one spell from the magus spell list as if it were in your spellbook and can prepare that spell as normal that day. If you do not cast spells prepared in this way before the next time you prepares spells, you lose those spells. You can also cast spells added in this way using your spell recall ability, but only until you prepares spells again.

The spell is prepared again, just as if it had not been cast. Furthermore, instead of recalling a used spell, as a swift action you can prepare a spell of the same level that you have in your spellbook. You do so by expending a number of points from your arcane pool equal to the spell's level (minimum 1). You cannot apply metamagic feats to a spell prepared in this way. You do not need to reference your spellbook to prepare a spell in this way.

As a full-round action, you can make all of your attacks with your melee weapon at a -2 penalty. You can also cast any spell from the magus spell list with a casting time of 1 standard action.

SOURCEPAGE:p.13

SOURCEPAGE:p.13
True Magus			KEY:True Magus ~ Magus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																		DESC:You are a master of spells and combat.

As a full-round action, you can make all of your attacks with your melee weapon without penalty. You can also cast any spell with a casting time of 1 standard action from the magus spell list. You can choose to cast the spell first or make the weapon attacks first, but you cannot cast the spell between weapon attacks if you have more than one attack. Casting a spell in this manner does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You must have one hand free to use this ability, even if the spell being cast does not contain somatic components. Whenever you use spell combat and your spell targets the same creature as your melee attacks, you can choose to either increase the DC to resist the spell by +2, grant yourself a +2 circumstance bonus on any checks made to overcome spell resistance, or grant yourself a +2 circumstance bonus on all attack rolls made against the target during your turn.

## Witch Hexes
Beast of Ill-Omen			KEY:Beast of Ill-Omen ~ WitchHex		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.WitchHex			DESC:The witch imbues her familiar with strange magic, putting a minor curse upon the next enemy to see it. The enemy must make a Will save or be affected by bane (caster level %1). The witch can use this hex on her familiar at a range of up to 60 feet. The affected enemy must be no more than 60 feet from the familiar to trigger the effect; seeing the familiar from a greater distance has no effect (though if the enemy and familiar approach to within 60 feet of each other, the hex takes effect). The bane affects the closest creature to the familiar (ties affect the creature with the highest initiative score). Whether or not the target's save is successful, the creature cannot be the target of the bane effect for 1 day (later uses of this hex ignore that creature when determining who is affected).|WitchLVL
Child-Scent				KEY:Child-Scent ~ WitchHex			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.WitchHex		DESC:The witch gains the scent ability, but only with respect to humanoid children and immature animals. Thus, she could sniff out a child's hiding place or a den of wolf pups, but not the child's parents or the den mother.
Feral Speech			KEY:Feral Speech ~ WitchHex			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.WitchHex			DESC:This hex grants the witch the ability to speak with and understand the response of any animal as if using speak with animals, though each time she uses the hex, she must decide to communicate with either amphibians, birds, fish, mammals, or reptiles, and can only speak to and understand animals of that type. The witch can make herself understood as far as her voice carries. This hex does not predispose any animal so addressed toward the witch in any way. At 12th level, the witch can use this hex to communicate with vermin.
Nails					KEY:Nails ~ WitchHex				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.WitchHex		DESC:The witch's nails are long and sharp, and count as natural weapons that deal 1d3 points of damage (1d2 for a Small witch). These attacks are secondary attacks. If trimmed, the witch's nails regrow to their normal size in 1d4 days.
Poison Steep			KEY:Poison Steep ~ WitchHex			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spelllike.WitchHex			DESC:The witch can use her cauldron to brew a foul toxin in which she can steep fruits and other delicious edibles, transforming them so that when eaten, they have the same effect as a poison spell. Brewing the toxin and then steeping the food takes 1 hour in total; steeping can affect up to 1 pound of food. The food is poisoned for 24 hours, and the poison cannot be transferred to other objects. The food tastes normal, but magic detects it as poisonous.		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Cauldron ~ WitchHex
Prehensile Hair			KEY:Prehensile Hair ~ WitchHex		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.WitchHex			DESC:The witch can instantly cause her hair (or even her eyebrows) to grow up to 10 feet long or to shrink to its normal length, and can manipulate her hair as if it were a limb with a Strength score equal to her Intelligence score. Her hair has reach 10 feet, and she can use it as a secondary natural attack that deals 1d3 points of damage (1d2 for a Small witch). Her hair can manipulate objects (but not weapons) as dexterously as a human hand. The hair cannot be sundered or attacked as a separate creature. Pieces cut from the witch's elongated hair shrink away to nothing. Using her hair does not harm the witch's head or neck, even if she lifts something heavy with it. The witch can manipulate her hair for %1 minutes per day; these minutes do not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. A typical male witch with this hex can also manipulate his beard, moustache, or eyebrows.|WitchLVL
Scar					KEY:Scar ~ WitchHex				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.WitchHex			DESC:This hex curses a single target with horrible scars of the witch's choosing, whether something as simple as a single letter on the target's forehead or blotchy, burnlike scars on his body. The target may make a Will save to resist this hex. These scars do not hinder the target's actions or abilities in any way. The witch can withdraw this hex from a target as a move action at any range. The number of supernatural scars the witch can maintain at once is %1; once she reaches this limit, she must remove the scar from a current victim in order to mark another. Effects that remove curses can remove the scar.|INT
Swamp Hag				KEY:Swamp Hag ~ WitchHex			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spelllike.WitchHex			DESC:While traveling through swamps, mires, bogs, and similar terrain, the witch leaves no trail and cannot be tracked, as the trackless step druid ability. The witch can walk through mud and even quicksand as if it were normal ground.
Unnerve Beasts			KEY:Unnerve Beasts ~ WitchHex			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.WitchHex			DESC:The target becomes offensive to animals (Will negates). Animals become distraught and aggressive in the victim's presence-horses buck, dogs snap and bark, bulls charge, and so on. The hex lasts for %1 hours. A creature that saves against the hex cannot be affected by the hex for 1 day. The reaction of the animals is a mind affecting charm effect, but the hex on the target is not.|INT
Water Lung				KEY:Water Lung ~ WitchHex			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.WitchHex			DESC:An air-breathing target can breathe water or an aquatic target can breathe air. This lasts 1 minute. If the witch uses this hex on herself, she can maintain it while she sleeps, allowing her to safely sleep underwater.

## Major Hexes
Major Hex - Beast Eye		KEY:Beast Eye ~ WitchMajorHex			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.WitchHex		PREVARGTEQ:WitchLVL,10	DESC:The witch can project her senses into an animal within 100 feet, sensing whatever it senses. She cannot control the animal's actions. She can project her senses from that animal to another within 100 feet of it as a standard action, and can continue to make these sensory leaps, potentially viewing things very far from her actual location. She may return her senses to her own body as a free action. Normal animals get no saving throw against this ability, but animal companions, paladin mounts, and similar unusual animals may resist with a Will save; the witch may use this ability on her own familiar as if it were an animal. If the witch has the coven hex, all other witches within 10 feet of her who also have the coven hex can see through this animal at will, although the acting witch still controls the ability. The witch can use this ability for %1 minutes per day. These minutes need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments.|WitchLVL
Major Hex - Cook People		KEY:Cook People ~ WitchMajorHex		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.WitchHex		PREVARGTEQ:WitchLVL,10	DESC:The witch can create fabulous spells by cooking an intelligent humanoid creature in her cauldron, either alive or dead. Using this hex creates one meal or serving of food of the witch's choice, typically a delicious stew or a dough suitable for cookies, pastries, or other desserts. Cooking the victim takes 1 hour. Eating the food provides one of the following benefits for 1 hour: age resistance*, bear's endurance, bull's strength, cat's grace, eagle's splendor, fox's cunning, neutralize poison (instantaneous) owl's wisdom, remove disease (instantaneous). Alternatively, the witch can shape the dough into a Small, humanlike creature, animating it as a homunculus for 1 hour. Using this hex or knowingly eating its food is an evil act.			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Cauldron ~ WitchHex
Major Hex - Hidden Home		KEY:Hidden Home ~ WitchMajorHex		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spelllike.WitchHex		PREVARGTEQ:WitchLVL,10	DESC:The witch can conceal or disguise her home and the area around it as if using mirage arcana. Before using the hex, she must spend 1 day pacing out the border of an area that measures roughly 40,000 square feet (approximately 200 feet by 200 feet) to define her home territory. Thereafter, she can use the hex to change the appearance of that area as a standard action as long as she is within the area. The illusion persists until the witch changes or dismisses it. For the purpose of this ability, a witch can only have one "home" at a time.
Major Hex - Hoarfrost		KEY:Hoarfrost ~ WitchMajorHex			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.WitchHex		PREVARGTEQ:WitchLVL,10	DESC:The target is rimed with a shell of frost needles that slowly work their way into its f lesh (Fortitude negates). The target turns pale and blue, and takes 1 point of Constitution damage per minute until it dies, saves (once per minute), or is cured. Break enchantment, dispel magic, remove curse, and similar spells end the effect. If the target saves, it is immune to this hex for 1 day. This is a cold effect.
Major Hex - Ice Tomb		KEY:Ice Tomb ~ WitchMajorHex			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.WitchHex		PREVARGTEQ:WitchLVL,10	DESC:A storm of ice and freezing wind envelops the target, which takes 3d8 points of cold damage (Fortitude half ). If the target fails its save, it is paralyzed and unconscious but does not need to eat or breathe while the ice lasts. The ice has 20 hit points; destroying the ice frees the creature, which is staggered for 1d4 rounds after being released. Whether or not the target's saving throw is successful, it cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.
Major Hex - Infected Wounds	KEY:Infected Wounds ~ WitchMajorHex		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.WitchHex		PREVARGTEQ:WitchLVL,10	DESC:The target's wounds become infected (Fortitude negates). The target takes 1 point of Constitution damage per day. After the first day, the target may save once per day to cure the infection. This is a disease effect.
Major Hex - Speak in Dreams	KEY:Speak in Dreams ~ WitchMajorHex		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spelllike.WitchHex		PREVARGTEQ:WitchLVL,10	DESC:The witch can contact a creature as if using dream. The witch can use this ability on %1 creatures per day, but can dream-speak to those creatures as often as desired throughout that time period.|INT
Major Hex - Witch's Brew	KEY:Witch's Brew ~ WitchMajorHex		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.WitchHex	PREVARGTEQ:WitchLVL,10	DESC:When the witch uses her cauldron to brew a potion, she may spend double the cost to create 2 identical potions that day instead of just 1. At 15th level, she may spend triple the cost to create 3 identical potions that day.		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Cauldron ~ WitchHex

## Grand Hexes
Grand Hex - Dire Prophecy	KEY:Dire Prophecy ~ WitchGrandHex		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.WitchHex		PREVARGTEQ:WitchLVL,18	DESC:The witch curses the target so he is doomed to die (Will negates). As long as the curse persists, the target takes a -4 penalty to his Armor Class and on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks. While the curse persists, the witch may end it by bringing its full force upon her victim all at once. Doing so gives the victim a penalty of %1 to his Armor Class or on any single attack roll, combat maneuver check, opposed ability or skill check, or saving throw. The witch must decide to apply this penalty before the roll to be modified is made. If the witch does not have line of sight to the target, the full force of the curse occurs when the GM considers it most appropriate, such as when the target is in mortal danger. A target can only have one dire prophecy upon him at a time. Whether or not the target's save against the hex is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex for 1 day. This is a curse effect.|WitchLVL
Grand Hex - Summon Spirit	KEY:Summon Spirit ~ WitchGrandHex		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spelllike.WitchHex		PREVARGTEQ:WitchLVL,18	DESC:The witch calls forth the ghost of a humanoid creature with no more than 18 Hit Dice. The ghost has its own personality and desires, but is willing to bargain with the witch, as if she had cast greater planar ally. To seal an agreement with the witch, the ghost requires life energy equal to 1 temporary negative level (this is in addition to the standard payment for the ghost's service). This negative level persists as long as the ghost remains in the service of the witch; the witch can end the agreement as a standard action, immediately removing the negative level.
Grand Hex - Witch's Hut		KEY:Witch's Hut ~ WitchGrandHex		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.WitchHex		PREVARGTEQ:WitchLVL,18	DESC:The witch can animate a hut, small house, covered wagon, tent, or similar construction as an animated object. The hut can be of up to Huge size (approximately 15 feet by 15 feet). The animated hut's hardness increases to 8 and its hit points double. The witch can give the hut the following commands: guard (the hut watches for trespassers within 120 feet using the witch's Perception modifier and screams if it spots any), hide (all entrances are hidden by illusory wall spells and locked with arcane lock), and move (moves at speed 60 on giant bird or bone legs as directed by the witch, even obeying commands such as "follow me from 100 feet away"). The hut remains animate for 24 hours, until she dismisses it or she animates another, at which time the hut stops where it is and reverts to its nonmagical state.
