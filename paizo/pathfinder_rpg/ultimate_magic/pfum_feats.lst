Advanced Ranger Trap			TYPE:General			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trap ~ Ranger											PRECLASS:1,Ranger=5																																																																																																																																							DESC:Your ranger traps are especially difficult to notice and avoid.																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.143	BENEFIT:Add +1 to the Difficulty Class on all Perception and Disable Device skill checks to find or disable the traps you make with your trap class feature. Add a +1 to the Difficulty Class on all saving throws against the effects of the trap you make with your trap class feature.
Antagonize					TYPE:General																																																																																																																																																																DESC:Whether with biting remarks or hurtful words, you are adept at making creatures angry with you.																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.143	BENEFIT:You can make Diplomacy and Intimidate checks to make creatures respond to you with hostility. No matter which skill you use, antagonizing a creature takes a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and has a DC equal to 10 + the target's Hit Dice + the target's Wisdom modifier.

SOURCEPAGE:p.148	BENEFIT:When you craft a magic weapon, magic armor, or magic shield, you may add one casting of consecrate or desecrate as part of the item crafting process. This increases the item's Price by 250 gp.  The item becomes a reliquary and can be used as a holy (or unholy) symbol divine focus of your deity. If you cast consecrate or desecrate, your reliquary counts as a permanent fixture for that spell while it remains in the spell's area.
Create Sanguine Elixir			TYPE:ItemCreation																						PRECLASS:1,Sorcerer=3			PREFEAT:1,Brew Potion																																																	PRESKILL:1,Craft (Alchemy)=12																																																						PRESTAT:1,CHA=15																				DESC:You can condense a fraction of your bloodline's power into a powerful elixir.																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.148	BENEFIT:Once per day, when you clear your mind to regain spell slots, you can create a sanguine elixir. When you do, pick one of your bloodline powers. You transfer that power into a small potion that any creature can drink to temporarily gain the benefit of your bloodline power. Creating a sanguine elixir takes 1 hour, and requires special oils and distillates worth 100 gp, and when you make the sanguine elixir, you lose access to the bloodline power until the next time you clear your mind to regain spell slots. Sanguine elixirs are extremely unstable. They lose their potency 1 day after they are created.
Defending Eidolon				TYPE:General			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Shield Ally																																																																																																																																																					DESC:You have trained your eidolon to protect you.																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.148	BENEFIT:Whenever you are adjacent to your eidolon, you can choose for the eidolon to take a -1 penalty on melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to gain a +1 dodge bonus to your Armor Class. When your eidolon's base attack bonus reaches +5, and for every +5 thereafter, the penalty increases by -1 and the dodge bonus increases by +1. You must choose to use this feat when your eidolon is making an attack or full-attack action with melee or natural weapons, and its effect lasts until your eidolon's next turn, or until you are no longer adjacent to the eidolon, whichever occurs f irst.
Deny Death										PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Ki Pool																		PREFEAT:1,Endurance																																																																																																																																	DESC:Your ki is so strong that it can deny death.																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.148	BENEFIT:As long as you have 1 ki point in your ki pool, when you fail your Constitution check to stabilize, you do not lose 1 hit point. If you succeed at the check, you can spend 1 ki point to heal 1d6 hit points. If you roll a natural 20 on the check to stabilize, you can spend 1 ki point to heal 2d6 hit points of damage instead.
Detect Expertise				TYPE:General																																																																																						PRESPELL:1,Detect Chaos,Detect Evil,Detect Good, Detect Law,Datect Magic																																								PRESTAT:1,INT=13																				DESC:You can detect the mystic specialty of a foe.																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.148	BENEFIT:When you use any of the spells listed in this feat's prerequisites to detect a creature's alignment or its magic, you have a chance of detecting what spellcasting expertise it has. After you observe a creature with the detect spell for 3 rounds, it must make a Will save (DC %1). If it fails the saving throw, you learn what bloodlines, domains, hexes, schools, or mysteries (if any) the creature possesses. If the creature makes its save, it is immune to the effects of this feat for 24 hours.|10+CASTERLEVEL+INT
Die for Your Master			TYPE:General			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Tumor Familiar																																																																																																																																																					DESC:Your tumor familiar goes to any length to save your life.																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.148	BENEFIT: If your tumor familiar is attached, and you would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the familiar throws itself in the way of the attack as an immediate action. If it makes a Ref lex saving throw (DC = damage dealt), it takes all the damage from the attack. If it fails, it takes half damage and you take half damage. The familiar must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to use this ability, and it can only do this once per day-if it is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, it can't use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow the familiar to make a Ref lex save for half damage, its improved evasion ability does not apply on this saving throw.
Divine Interference			TYPE:General																						PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER.Divine=10																																																																																																																																					DESC:You can convert a spell to interfere with an enemy's attack.																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.149	BENEFIT:As an immediate action, when an enemy within 30 feet hits an ally with an attack, you can sacrifice a prepared divine spell or (if you are a spontaneous caster) an unused spell slot and make the enemy reroll the attack roll. The second attack roll takes a penalty equal to the level of the spell you sacrifice. You must sacrifice a spell of 1st-level or higher to use this ability. Whether or not the second attack is successful, you cannot use this effect on the same creature again for 1 day.

SOURCEPAGE:p.149	BENEFIT:When fighting dragons, your aura of courage expands to a 20-foot-radius emanation, and allies in the aura gain a morale bonus on saving throws against dragon breath equal to your aura of courage's bonus against fear effects.
Echoing Spell				TYPE:Metamagic																																																																																																																																																																DESC:You have learned how to release most, but not all, of a spell's potential when you cast it.																											ADDSPELLLEVEL:3																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.149	BENEFIT:When you cast an echoing spell, it does not disappear entirely from memory, and you can cast it one additional time during that day. No effect that allows you to reprepare or recast a spell can affect the echoed spell. If you prepare spells, this second casting does not require you to prepare it in another spell slot. If you spontaneously cast spells, this second casting does not expend another available spell slot. An echoing spell uses up a spe

SOURCEPAGE:p.149	BENEFIT:When you are performing, allies within 20 feet who also have this feat can aid you with your Perform checks (including those made as part of bardic performance) as if they were aiding another as an immediate action. The allies make their aid another rolls before you make your check. No more than four allies can grant you a bonus with aid another.

The familiar must conform to any limitations of the evolution. For instance, no familiars can benefit from the mount evolution and only familiars with wings can take the wing buffet evolution.

SOURCEPAGE:p.152	BENEFIT:You may implant a bomb in a willing or helpless creature (a mindless creature under your control, such as a zombie, counts as willing for this purpose). This takes 1 hour and expends 1 use of your bomb ability for the day. When the implanted creature dies or is destroyed, the bomb detonates in the creature's square as if it were a delayed bomb set by you (though you can set the bomb's damage to less than your normal bomb damage). You can use any bomb-affecting discoveries on this implanted bomb (acid bomb, frost bomb, smoke bomb, and so on) as normal. The bomb automatically detonates 24 hours after you implant it in the creature.	BENEFIT:If you expend 150 gp worth of alchemical reagents per die of the bomb's damage (for example, 750 gp for a 5d6 bomb), the bomb does not automatically detonate after 24 hours, and only detonates if the creature dies or is destroyed (24 hours after implantation, this bomb no longer counts toward your daily total).	BENEFIT:Implanting a bomb is as invasive as using the Heal skill to treat deadly wounds and leaves surgical scars unless the creature is healed by magic or abilities such as regeneration or fast healing. Some creatures (such as oozes, elementals, and creatures with the incorporeal quality) cannot have bombs implanted in them. Removing an implanted bomb requires a Heal check to treat deadly wounds, followed by a dispel magic spell or Disable Device check to neutralize the bomb (DC %1).|11 + classlevel("Alchemist")

Discovery (Fast Study)			TYPE:Discovery.WizardBonus	PRECLASS:1,Wizard=5	DESC:You can prepare all your spells in 15 minutes.							SOURCEPAGE:p.86	BENEFIT:Normally, a wizard spends 1 hour preparing all of his spells for the day, or proportionately less if he only prepares some spells, with a minimum of 15 minutes of preparation. Thanks to mental discipline and clever mnemonics, you can prepare all of your spells in only 15 minutes, and your minimum preparation time is only 1 minute.
Discovery (Feral Speech)		TYPE:Discovery.WizardBonus	PRECLASS:1,Wizard=5	DESC:You gain the ability to speak with animals.							SOURCEPAGE:p.86	BENEFIT:You gain the ability to speak with and understand the response of any animal as if using speak with animals, though each time you speak to animals, you must decide to communicate with either amphibians, birds, fish, mammals	DESC:vermin|PRECLASS:1,Wizard=12	DESC:or reptiles, and can only speak to and understand animals of that type. You can make yourself understood as far as your voice carries. This discovery does not predispose any animal so addressed toward you in any way.
Discovery (Golem Constructor)		TYPE:Discovery.WizardBonus	PRECLASS:1,Wizard=9	DESC:You have learned the art and craft of constructing a single type of golem.		SOURCEPAGE:p.86	BENEFIT:You have learned the art and craft of creating a single type of golem (such as stone golems or iron golems).

SOURCEPAGE:p.86	BENEFIT:You discover a cure for aging, and from this point forward you take no penalty to your physical ability scores from advanced age. If you are already taking such penalties, they are removed at this time.
Discovery (Multimorph)			TYPE:Discovery.WizardBonus.Supernatural	PRECLASS:1,Wizard=5	DESC:Your studies in transmogrification have increased your control over shapechanging spells.	SOURCEPAGE:p.86	BENEFIT:Your studies in transmogrification have increased your control over shapechanging spells. When you cast a spell of the polymorph subschool on yourself, you may expend 1 minute of the spell's duration as a standard action to assume another form allowed by the spell. You can do this as often as you like, subject to the duration of the spell.
Discovery (Opposition Research)	TYPE:Discovery.WizardBonus	PRECLASS:1,Wizard=9	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.ArcaneSchool	DESC:You have broken through the mental barriers that made it hard for you to prepare spells from one of your opposition schools.	SOURCEPAGE:p.86	BENEFIT:By completing strenuous studies, you have broken through the mental barriers that made it hard for you to prepare spells from one of your opposition schools.

SOURCEPAGE:p.86	BENEFIT:Once per day, when you prepare spells, you may treat any one of your open spell slots as if it were two spell slots that were two spell levels lower. For example, a 9th-level wizard can split a 5th-level slot into two 3rd-level slots, preparing fireball and lightning bolt in those 3rd-level slots. For all purposes, the two lower-level slots are treated as that lower level (so the split 5th-level slot used for a fireball has a DC as if it were in a normal 3rd-level slot). Splitting a 2nd-level slot lets you prepare two additional cantrips (which you can cast over and over, just like normally prepared cantrips). This discovery has no effect on cantrips or 1st-level spells.

Discovery (True Name)			TYPE:Discovery.WizardBonus.SpellLike	PRECLASS:1,Wizard=11	DESC:You have discovered the true name of an outsider.	SOURCEPAGE:p.87	BENEFIT:Your researches into ancient tomes and your inquisitions of bound spirits have led you to one of the best-hidden secrets of the multiverse: the true name of an outsider-the name that defines the very essence of the creature and that gives the speaker control over the being. This outsider can have no more than 12 Hit Dice. Once per day, you can speak the common name by which the outsider is known, and the outsider travels to you as if you had cast planar binding upon it. It must obey you to the best of its ability, without pay or bargaining for its services, for its fear that you might release its true name to the wider world is enough to bring even the most recalcitrant of outsiders to bear. If the creature is within 100 feet, as a move action, you may punish it by deliberately mispronouncing its name, wracking its very essence and giving it the sickened and staggered conditions for 1 round (even if the creature is normally immune to these conditions). You cannot use true name in an area of silence, but the creature does not have to be able to hear you for it to be harmed by the ability. It is in your best interest to call this creature only sparingly, and occasionally reward it in some fashion to mollify its wrath. If you repeatedly fail to offer it a reward appropriate to its type and ethos, the creature may begin plotting ways to destroy the bond between you, whether by creating an accident that will destroy your memory of the name, by plaguing you with nuisances or dangers until you vow never to call on it again, or by actively seeking to destroy you through its own devices or those of an underling. If this creature is of a lawful type and you are violating its ethos, its superiors may even destroy it or you rather than allow you to contaminate their servant further. Worse, they may establish situations where it is necessary for you to summon this outsider, opening gateways to infernal or angelic interference, in order to gain a foothold on the Material Plane.

Discovery (Greater True Name)		TYPE:Discovery.WizardBonus.SpellLike	PRECLASS:1,Wizard=15	DESC:You have discovered the true name of a powerful outsider.	SOURCEPAGE:p.87	BENEFIT:Your researches into ancient tomes and your inquisitions of bound spirits have led you to one of the best-hidden secrets of the multiverse: the true name of an outsider-the name that defines the very essence of the creature and that gives the speaker control over the being. This outsider can have no more than 18 Hit Dice. Once per day, you can speak the common name by which the outsider is known, and the outsider travels to you as if you had cast greater planar binding upon it. It must obey you to the best of its ability, without pay or bargaining for its services, for its fear that you might release its true name to the wider world is enough to bring even the most recalcitrant of outsiders to bear.

Discovery (Staff-Like Wand)		TYPE:Discovery.WizardBonus	PRECLASS:1,Wizard=11	PREFEAT:1,Craft Staff	DESC:You use your own power when using a wand.		SOURCEPAGE:p.87	BENEFIT:Your research has unlocked a new power in conjunction with using a wand. Similar to using a magic staff, you use your own Intelligence score and relevant feats to set the DC for saves against spells you cast from a wand, and you can use your caster level when activating the power of a wand if it's higher than the caster level of the wand.
