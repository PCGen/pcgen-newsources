#Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A Vispilio de Magus gains no proficiency with any weapon or armor. A Vispilio de Magus can cast his class spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, like any other arcane spellcaster, a Vispilio de Magus wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component (which most do). A multiclassed Vispilio de Magus still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance when casting arcane spells received from his other classes.

comprehend languages, identify, jump.

legend lore, prying eyes.


Bonus Feat At first level, and then again each
odd-numbered level (3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level), the
Vispilio de Magus gets a bonus Skill Focus feat for any skill
listed amongst the prerequisite skills in which he has maximum
ranks in. If he already has the Skill Focus Feat for
