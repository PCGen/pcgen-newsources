Ancestral Heritage (Fetchling)
The human ancestry that fetchlings come from appears
more prominently in you.
Prerequisite: Fetchling
Benefit: You count as both fetchling and human and
for any effects related to race, such as taking traits, feats,
how spells and magic items affect you, and so on.
Special: You may not take the Racial HeritageAPG
feat, even though it is normally available to humans.
Arcane Veil
You can convert any spell into an invisible veil.
Prerequisite: Spell Focus (Illusion), Arcane
spellcaster, caster level 9th
Benefit: As a standard action, you can sacrifice a
prepared spell or unused spell slot of 1st level or higher
and transform it into a transparent veil, granting yourself
invisibility, as the spell. This invisibility lasts for 2 rounds
for every level of the spell or spell slot you sacrificed.
Once the invisibility ends (for any reason), you cannot
use this feat again for 1 minute.
Concealing Trick
You can share your secrets of stealth with allies.
Prerequisite: Hide in Plain Sight, Slayer Camouflage,
or Camouflage class feature, character level 13th
Benefit: You can grant a single ally adjacent to you the
benefits of your hide in plain sight, slayer camouflage, or
camouflage class feature. Doing this is a move action
and lasts as long as that ally remains adjacent to you.
You may only grant this ability to a single ally at a time.
For the purpose of these abilities, the ally is considered
to share your chosen favored terrains (though they do
not gain any other benefits that favored terrain grants).
The ally must still meet the rest of the conditions of the
ability to make use of it.
Dissolution’s Embrace (Wayang)
The Dissolution calls you to be one with the shadows.
Prerequisite: Wayang
Benefit: Whenever you are in dim light or darkness,
you may take 10 on Stealth checks, even if circumstances
would normally prevent you from taking 10 on skill
checks. This does not grant you the ability to make
Stealth checks while being observed.
Normal: Distractions or threats (such as combat)
make it impossible for a character to take 10.

Benefit: While in dim light or darkness, you gain a +1

caster level is equal to your character level.
Improved Shadow Magic (Wayang)
Shadow magic comes more naturally to you than others
of your race.
Prerequisite: Wayang, Shadow Magic racial trait,
Charisma 13
Benefit: You may use shape shadows* as a spell-like
ability at will, and add silent image and darkness to the
spell-like abilities that you may use once each per day.
Your caster level is equal to your character level.
Lingering Shadows
Your darkness spells are harder to suppress.
Prerequisite: Able to cast at least one spell with the
darkness descriptor, caster level 5th
Benefit: Magical light sources cannot increase the
light level within the area of spells you cast with the
darkness descriptor (such as deeper darkness) unless the
light spell is at least two spell levels higher than your
darkness spell. Spells with the light descriptor cannot
be used to counter or dispel your darkness spells unless
they are at least one spell level higher than your darkness
spells.
Normal: Most spells that lower lighting conditions
(such as darkness) can have the area brightened by a light
spell at least one level higher than the darkness spell.
Most spells with the light descriptor can be used to
counter and dispel a darkness spell of the same spell
level or lower.
Night Caster (Wayang)
Shadow spells you cast are stronger than normal.
Prerequisite: Wayang, caster level 1st
Benefit: When you cast spells of the shadow
subschool or spells with the darkness descriptor, your
caster level considered two higher when determining the
duration and range of those spells.
Night Dweller
Your long time spent in darkness has made you
accustomed to its terrors.
Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws
against fear, phantasm, darkness, and shadow effects.
The DC of Intimidate checks made to demoralize you
increases by 5.
Realistic Illusions
Your illusion spells are so realistic that creatures are
inclined to believe them, even when faced with proof
of their falsehood.
Prerequisite: Spell Focus (Illusion)
Benefit: A character faced with proof that an illusion
spell you cast isn’t real must still make a saving throw,
but does so at a +4 bonus. If any viewer successfully
disbelieves an illusion you cast and communicates this
fact to others, each such viewer gets a saving throw but
gets no bonus to the check.
Normal: A character faced with proof that an
illusion isn’t real needs no saving throw. If any viewer
successfully disbelieves an illusion and communicates
this fact to others, each such viewer gains a saving throw
with a +4 bonus.
Recover Senses
You quickly regain your senses when they are attacked.
Prerequisite: Great Fortitude
Benefit: When you fail a save against an effect that
causes you to become blinded, dazzled, deafened, or
otherwise hinders you sense of sight or hearing, you can
make a second save to negate the effect on the start of
your next turn. Only one additional save is allowed. If
the effect does not allow a saving throw, its duration is
halved instead (minimum of 1 round). This only applies
to the effects that hinder your senses; any other effects
such as damage, fear, or a different condition that
accompanies the effect remain.
Shadow Gift
With a shadowy touch, you can grant a small portion of
your shadow magic to another.
Prerequisite: Shadow surge† class feature, nightblade
level 7th
Benefit: As a full-round action, you can touch an ally
to grant it a single shadow surge that you currently have.

# 39
If the target has the shadow surge class feature, it can
use that shadow surge with any of its class features that
utilize shadow surges. If the ally does not normally have
the shadow surge class feature, that ally can spend the
shadow surge as a free action when making a Stealth
check to enshroud itself in darkness, letting it roll twice
and take the better result.
In addition, if you have another method of expending
a shadow surge, you may grant the ally that ability as
well. You may only grant one other ability that expends
shadow surges in this manner, and it must be usable by a
nightblade of half your level. For any purpose based on
level, the creature is treated as a nightblade of half your
nightblade level to determine the effects of the ability.
This can be granted to creatures with or without the
shadow surge class feature. The ally loses this granted
ability once it has spent the shadow surge.
The shadow surge must be spent by the ally within
1 hour, otherwise it is lost. You may only give out 1
shadow surge at a time in this manner, and cannot give
out another one until the first is used or lost.
Shadow Summoner
Creatures you summon gain the power of darkness.
Prerequisite: Spell Focus (Conjuration)
Benefit: Whenever you summon a creature from the
summon monster spell list that indicates it is summoned
with either the celestial or the fiendish template based on
your alignment, you can summon the creature with the
shadow creature template instead.
Shadow Traveler (Fetchling)
You are able to take others with you when you journey
to your home plane.
Prerequisite: Fetchling, plane shift spell-like ability,
character level 15th
Benefit: You can use plane shift an additional time each
day, and can now take along other willing creatures. You
may still only shift to either the Material Plane or the
Plane of Shadow.
Normal: Fetchlings may not bring other creatures
with them when using their plane shift spell-like ability.
Shadowy Disguise (Fetchling)
The disguise you don is made of shadow magic, making
it partially real.
Prerequisite: Fetchling, disguise self spell-like ability
Benefit: You can use disguise self an additional time
each day. When you use your disguise self spell-like ability,
the disguise is partially made real with shadowstuff,
letting it actually alter the tactile (touch) or audible
(sound) properties of you and your equipment.
Normal: Disguise self cannot alter the perceived tactile
or audible properties of you or your equipment.
Shadowy Dodge (Combat)
The shadows provide ample cover for you to dodge
about your foes.
Prerequisite: Acrobatics 5 ranks
Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on Acrobatics
checks made to move through a threatened area or an
opponent’s space as long you are within dim light or
darkness. In addition, as long as you are in dim light or
darkness, the dodge bonus to AC granted from fighting
defensively increases by +1, and the dodge bonus to AC
granted from the total defense action increases by +2.
Tenacious Illusions
Illusions you cast are hard to dispel.
Prerequisite: Spell Focus (Illusion)
Benefit: The DC of caster level checks to dispel or
remove your illusions increases by 2; even if the spell is
dispelled, it persists for 1 more round before dissipating.
Terrifying Ambush (Combat)
You strike terror in those you catch off guard.
Prerequisite: Weapon Focus, Dazzling Display
Benefit: Whenever you hit a creature with a
weapon with which you have Weapon Focus during
the surprise round, you can use a free action to make
an Intimidate check to demoralize all foes within 30
feet (including the creature struck) who witnessed your
attack.
Umbral Striker (Combat)
Your arcane strike now infuses your weapon with
shadowy energy.
Prerequisite: Arcane Strike, caster level 7th
Benefit: When you use the Arcane Strike feat, your
weapons are also considered silver and cold iron for the
purpose of bypassing damage reduction. In addition,
you may choose to have the bonus damage dealt by
Arcane Strike be cold damage, as opposed to dealing the
weapon’s damage type. This cold damage does not stack
with other cold effects, such as a frost enchantment, but
is multiplied on a critical hit.
Unseen Terror
Creatures are naturally afraid of what they cannot see.
Prerequisite: Intimidate 5 ranks, Stealth 5 ranks
Benefit: You can make Intimidate checks to
demoralize a creature even if it cannot see you. You must
still influence it in some other way, such as by taunting,
making sounds, or using visual effects such as silent image
or light from a torch. You gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate
checks made while in dim light or darkness.
Normal: You can only make an Intimidate check to
demoralize an opponent if it is within 30 feet and can
clearly see and hear you.
