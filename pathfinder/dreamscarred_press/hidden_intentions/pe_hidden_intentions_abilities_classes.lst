Immediately after the switch occurs, the mindleap contingency triggers, and the linked power takes effect on the body you were in when you established the contingency. Any choices to be made about the effect must be made when the power is manifest, not when it triggers. Saving throws made against a mindleap contingent power suffer a -5 penalty due to the sudden shift in bodies. Using this ability is akin to using a metapsionic feat - you must expend your psionic focus when establishing a mindleap contingency, and establishing one increases the power's power point cost by 4.

Greater Melding Exchange	KEY:Greater Melding Exchange ~ Body Snatcher	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:When you use your melding exchange ability, your draw far more knowledge from your target than usual. You may use the subject's ranks in Knowledge skills in place of your own, and you learns the command words or thoughts for any items the subject has (provided they were known to the subject). Additionally, as a standard action, you may expend your psionic focus to mentally "ask" your newfound memories one question, typically about the subject's past or personality. You learn the answer to that question to the best of the subject's knowledge. Asking about rote facts is often unnecessary, due to the granting of Knowledge ranks - this ability extends beyond the Knowledge skill.	SOURCEPAGE:p.45
Death Is Only the Beginning	KEY:Death Is Only the Beginning ~ Body Snatcher	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Common folklore suggests that many people see their lives flash before their eyes just before they die. In some ways, this is literal truth for you, although you tend to see only opportunity. Immediately upon being reduced to -1 hit points or lower, or failing a saving throw against an effect that would kill you, you may expend your psionic focus to manifest true mind switch as an immediate action at the same manifester level you manifest mind switch. You may only target your killer with this effect (thus, if the killer is out of range, this ability is worthless), and the save DC is reduced by 4 due to the desperate nature of this technique. If successful, your mind switches places with your killer's just before dying. You suffer level loss as normal for losing your previous body after a true mind switch.  You may apply all your body snatcher class features (except seal the host) to any manifestation of true mind switch, even one made at the moment of death.

###Block: Soul Archer abilities
Ranged Feat			KEY:Ranged Feat ~ Soul Archer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			DESC:The soul archer's ranged feat should come from feats with Point-Blank Shot as a prerequisite.	SOURCEPAGE:p.46
Ranged Blade Skills	KEY:Ranged Blade Skills ~ Soul Archer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			DESC:The soul archer's ranged blade skills should be blade skills that a soulbolt would qualify for, except not Alter Mind Bolt.	SOURCEPAGE:p.46
Form Mind Arrow		KEY:Form Mind Arrow ~ Soul Archer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			DESC:You can choose to shape your mind blade as a semisolid arrow of psychic energy and form a mind arrow as a free action.  If you have the ability to make multiple attacks, you can create multiple mind arrows as part of an attack.  You must have one hand free to create and fire a mind arrow.  The arrow is identical in all ways (except visually) to an arrow shot from a composite longbow of a size appropriate to you. You add your Wisdom modifier to the damage for attacks made with mind arrows, instead of your Strength modifier. The mind arrow receives all the benefits normally applied to the mind blade, including the ability to use psychic strike, any enhancement bonus or weapon special abilities, or feats that apply to the mind blade, although any melee-specific options are non-functional while in mind arrow form. Ranged feats that apply to ranged attacks, such as Point-Blank Shot, apply to the mind arrow. Any weapon special abilities that apply to the mind blade are inactive while in mind arrow form until the soulknife spends the normal amount of time to reassign the special abilities of the mind blade.

Ranged Psychic Strike	KEY:Ranged Psychic Strike ~ Soul Archer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			DESC:Your psychic strike damage when your mind blade is in mind arrow form increases by %1 dice of damage.|RangedPsychicStrikeBonusDice	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DEFINE:RangedPsychicStrikeBonusDice|0	BONUS:VAR|RangedPsychicStrikeBonusDice|floor(classlevel("Soul Archer")/4)
Reflexive Shot		KEY:Reflexive Shot ~ Soul Archer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:You can make attacks of opportunity with your mind arrows.  You still threaten squares you could reach with your mind blade or unarmed strikes, and can still only make one attack of opportunity per round (unless you have additional sources of attacks of opportunity such as the Combat Reflexes feat).	SOURCEPAGE:p.47
Phasing Shot		KEY:Phasing Shot ~ Soul Archer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:You can expend your psionic focus and make a single ranged touch attack as a standard action and launch a mind arrow at a target within range. The mind arrow travels to the target in a straight path, passing through any nonmagical or nonpsionic barrier or wall on its way. (A wall of force, wall of fire, wall of ectoplasm, or the like stops a mind arrow.) This ability negates cover and concealment, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally.	SOURCEPAGE:p.47
Empowered Shot		KEY:Empowered Shot ~ Soul Archer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:You can expend your psionic focus to grant the effect of a single feat that requires focus expenditure to apply to all attacks in a full attack sequence that round. The feat must only work on ranged attacks.	SOURCEPAGE:p.47
