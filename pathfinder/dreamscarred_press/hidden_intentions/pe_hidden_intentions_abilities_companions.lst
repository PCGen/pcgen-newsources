###Block: Astral Warrior abilities
Link			KEY:Link ~ Astral Warrior		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:An ectopic artisan and his astral warrior share a mental link that allows for communication across any distance (as long as they are on the same plane). This communication is a free action, allowing the ectopic artisan to give orders to his astral warrior at any time. In addition, magic items interfere with the ectopic artisan's connection to his astral warrior. As a result, the ectopic artisan and his astral warrior share magic item slots. For example, if the ectopic artisan is wearing a ring, his astral warrior can wear no more than one ring. In case of a conflict, the items worn by the ectopic artisan remain active, and those used by the astral warrior become dormant.
