Augment: You can augment your surge blast in one of the following ways.  1. If you spend 2 additional power points, your surge blast deals splash damage.  2. If you spend 3 additional power points, your surge blast is instead a 5 ft. emanation centered on you and cratures in the affected area gain a Reflex save (DC %1) to take half damage.  3. If you spend 4 additional power points, your surge blast deals half damage, but damages all creatures in a 30 ft. line.  4. If you spend 4 additional power points, your surge blast is empowered, dealing 50%% additional damage.  5. If you spend 4 additional power points, your surge blast is a 15 ft. cone effect instead of a ranged touch attack, and creatures in the affected area gain a Reflex save (DC %1) to take half damage.  6.
