Gun Kata			KEY:Gun Kata ~ Grammaton		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			DESC:You learn how to channel your disrupt pattern into vicious melee attacks through your guns.  You can use your guns to perform melee attacks that deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage plus the base dirsupt pattern damage, with a critical multiplier of 20/x2.

For each successful melee attack made with a handgun, if that gun is loaded, you can make a free ranged attack with that handgun against the creature struck.  These ranged touch attacks do not provoke attacks of opportunity.	SOURCEPAGE:p.69

Thundering Shot		KEY:Thundering Shot ~ Psionic Deed		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLvl11.DeedsHasGritCost.Supernatural	DESC:At 11th level, the gunslinger can spend 1 grit point and fire her gun into the ground at her feet to cause a concussive blast to all creatures within 30 ft. of her.

The target is staggered and can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor may it take full-round actions).  Additionally, it takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves.  The creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for decreased speed.  This effect lasts for %1 rounds.|SlowingShotDuration	SOURCEPAGE:p.73	PREVARGT:IsPsionic,0	DEFINE:SlowingShotDuration|0	BONUS:VAR|SlowingShotDuration|max(1,WIS)
