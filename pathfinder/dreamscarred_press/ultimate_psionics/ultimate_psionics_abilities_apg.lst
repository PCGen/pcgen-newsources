Horror							KEY:Horror ~ Nightmare Constructor			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																		DEFINE:HorrorLVL|0												DESC:You are able to form a creature created from distilled fears and nightmares.  Creating a horror takes one minute of concentration to complete and the horror remains until dismissed by you.  This horror functions as a summoner's eidolon using your class level as the summoner level, with the following exceptions.  A horror is a mindless construct like an astral construct and not an outsider, so it is subject to effects like dismiss ectoplasm instead of effects like banishment.  Commanding a horror is the same as commanding an astral construct.  A horror disperses if you are rendered unconscious or die.  You can allow your horror to use your terrors, but such uses still count against your daily limit.

Devastating Touch						KEY:Devastating Touch ~ Nightmare Constructor	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																	DESC:Your horror gains the devastating touch ability of a dread, using your class level to determine the total damage dealt.  This also allows you to select terrors that modify devastating touch, but these terrors only apply to the horror's use of devastating touch.

Fear Surge							KEY:Fear Surge ~ Nightmare Constructor		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																		DEFINE:FearSurgeRange|30	DEFINE:FSEPhandler|0	DEFINE:FearSurgeEvolutionPoints|0	DESC:When you are within %1 ft. of a creature that suffers from the shaken, frightened, or panicked condition, you gain %2 additional evolution points to spend on the horror.  These evolution points only last while there is a creature within %1 ft. of the horror with the shaken, frightened, or panicked condition.|FearSurgeRange|FearSurgeEvolutionPoints																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														BONUS:VAR|FearSurgeEvolutionPoints|1	TEMPBONUS:PC|VAR|FSEPhandler|FearSurgeEvolutionPoints																				SOURCEPAGE:p.268

# COMMENT: Won't try to implement this; it's probably currently impossible.
Horrific Infusion						KEY:Horrific Infusion ~ Nightmare Constructor	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																	DESC:You can merge with your horror as a standard action. You wear the horror like translucent and undulating armor. The horror mimics all of your movements, and you perceive through the horror's senses and speak through its voice, as the two are now one creature. You direct all of the horror's actions while merged. While merged with your horror, you use the horror's Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, but retain your own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. You gain the horror's hit points as temporary hit points. When these hit points reach 0, the horror is killed and sent back to its home plane. You use the horror's base attack bonus, and gain the horror's armor and natural armor bonuses and modifiers to ability scores. You also gain access to the horror's special abilities and the horror's evolutions. You are still limited to the horror's maximum number of natural attacks. The horror has no skills or feats of its own. The horror must be at least the same size as you. The horror must have limbs for you to cast spells with somatic components (should you have spellcasting ability). While fused, you lose the benefits of your armor. You count both as your original type and as a construct for any effect related to type, whichever is worse for you. Powers such as dismiss ectoplasm work on the horror, but you are unaffected. Neither you nor your horror can be targeted separately, as you are fused into one creature. You and your horror cannot take separate actions. While fused with your horror, you can use all of your own abilities and gear, except for your armor. In all other cases, this ability functions as the normal horror ability.

Empowered in Fear						KEY:Empowered in Fear ~ Nightmare Constructor	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																	DESC:Your horror is treated as if under the effect of physical acceleration any time it is within 30 ft. of a shaken, frightened, or panicked creature.	DESC:Your horror is also treated as if under the form of doom power when within 30 ft. of a shaken, frightened, or panicked creature.  This effect allows the horror to have more natural attacks than its normal eidolon form limit.	SOURCEPAGE:p.269

###Block: Mutator Blue Alchemist archetype abilities
Mutator	KEY:Alchemist Archetype ~ Mutator	CATEGORY:Archetype	TYPE:Archetype.AlchemistArchetype.AlchemistMutagen.AlchemistSwiftPoisoning	PRERACE:1,Blue	PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=1	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,Alchemist Archetype ~ Mutator],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.AlchemistSwiftPoisoning,TYPE.AlchemistMutagen]	DESC:You create a highly volatile mutagen capable of transforming your form and altering your size.

Volatile Mutagen			KEY:Volatile Mutagen ~ Mutator			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DEFINE:AlchemistMutagenLVL|0	DEFINE:AlchemistMutagenDuration|0	DEFINE:AlchemistMutagenDC|0	DESC:You know how to create an unusually mutagen that you can imbibe in order to heighten your physical prowess at the cost of your personality. It takes 1 hour to brew a dose of mutagen, and once brewed, it remains potent until used. You can only maintain one dose of mutagen at a time - if you brew a second dose, any existing mutagen becomes inert. A mutagen that is not in your possession becomes inert until an alchemist picks it up again. When you brew a mutagen, you select one physical ability score - either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. It's a standard action to drink a mutagen. Upon being imbibed, the mutagen causes you to grow bulkier and more bestial, granting you a +2 natural armor bonus and a +1d4+2 alchemical bonus to the selected ability score for %1 minutes. In addition, while the mutagen is in effect, you take a -(1d4+1) penalty to one of your mental ability scores. If the mutagen enhances your Strength, it applies a penalty to your Intelligence. If it enhances your Dexterity, it applies a penalty to your Wisdom. If it enhances your Constitution, it applies a penalty to your Charisma. A non-alchemist who drinks a mutagen must make a DC %2 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1 hour - a non-alchemist can never gain the benefit of a mutagen, but an alchemist can gain the effects of another alchemist's mutagen if he drinks it. (Although if the other alchemist creates a different mutagen, the effects of the "stolen" mutagen immediately cease.) The effects of a mutagen do not stack. Whenever an alchemist drinks a mutagen, the effects of any previous mutagen immediately end.  Bonuses increase to 1d6+3 via greater mutagen and 1d8+4 with grand mutagen, instead of the normal changes of those discoveries.|AlchemistMutagenDuration|AlchemistMutagenDC																ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Volatile Mutagen Strength ~ Mutator|Volatile Mutagen Dexterity ~ Mutator|Volatile Mutagen Constitution ~ Mutator	BONUS:VAR|AlchemistMutagenDuration|AlchemistMutagenLVL*10	BONUS:VAR|AlchemistMutagenDC|10+(AlchemistMutagenLVL/2)+INT	SOURCEPAGE:p.xx

Anyone striking you with a melee weapon while under the effects of this discovery takes %1d6 points fire damage.  Creatures making melee attacks from more than 5 ft. away with reach weapons do not suffer this damage.  If you die from the attack, all creatures within 10 feet of the mutator take %2d6 fire damage as your body bursts in a fiery explosion.|CombustibleMutagenDice|CombustibleMutagenExplosionDice	SOURCEPAGE:p.xx	DEFINE:CombustibleMutagenDice|0	BONUS:VAR|CombustibleMutagenDice|floor(AlchemistDiscoveryLVL/4)	DEFINE:CombustibleMutagenExplosionDice|floor(TL/2)	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Discovery ~ Combustible Mutagen
Sizable Mutation		KEY:Sizable Mutation ~ Mutator	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	DESC:By mixing a prepared extract into your mutagen, you can add an enlarge person or reduce person effect to that mutagen, although the original effect of the extract is wasted.  The effect lasts for the duration of the mutation.  However, once the effect of the mutagen ends, you take 2 points of ability damage to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution.	SOURCEPAGE:p.xx
