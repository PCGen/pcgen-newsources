# CHECK:
#   For all Prestige Classes that advance manifesting or mind blade or astral suit:
#     Weirdness with power points - BL=Class doesn't always add to ClassML?
#     Should also have PC in the CHOOSE statement, but PC isn't picking up Psychic Warrior (and maybe others?).

Body Thief				KEY:Body Thief ~ Body Snatcher			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary								DESC:You can manifest mind switch at a higher manifester level.																																																																																																																																																																							BONUS:CASTERLEVEL|SPELL.Mind Switch|classlevel("Body Snatcher")														SOURCEPAGE:p.43	SPELLKNOWN:CLASS|SPELLCASTER.Psionic=6|Mind Switch
Extended Transfer			KEY:Extended Transfer ~ Body Snatcher		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary								DESC:You can apply your Extend Power feat to your mind switch power without spending additional power points.  You still need to expend your psionic focus to use this ability.																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.44
Melding Exchange			KEY:Melding Exchange ~ Body Snatcher		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DEFINE:MeldingExchangeBonus|0			DESC:During a mind switch, your mind briefly interfaces with that of your target, resulting in a one-way exchange of information.  In addition to rudimentary or instinctive knowledge of the subject as normal for the power, you also learn the subject's name, where he lives, and who his principal associates and enemies are.  While you remain in the subject's body, you also gain knowledge of all of the subject's languages (written and spoken), treat any Knowledge check made with a skill with which the subject had ranks as a trained check, and gains a +%1 competence bonus on any skill check used to impersonate the subject.|MeldingExchangeBonus																																																																																		BONUS:VAR|MeldingExchangeBonus|2*classlevel("Body Snatcher")		SOURCEPAGE:p.44

While under the influence of mind switch, you gain the host body's weapon and armor proficiencies.  Additionally, you may choose to use your host's ranks in skills keyed to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution instead of your own.  Your training limites how completely you can draw upon your host, though - you cannot emulate a higher rank than %1.|FleshRemembersSkillRankLimit																																																																																																										BONUS:VAR|FleshRemembersSkillRankLimit|INT+classlevel("Body Snatcher")	SOURCEPAGE:p.44
Traumatic Transfer		KEY:Traumatic Transfer ~ Body Snatcher		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary								DESC:When manifesting mind switch, you may elect to make the process traumatic and disorienting to the other mind.  The subject is stunned for 1 round upon arriving in your body, and is dazed for 1d4 rounds thereafter.																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.44
Mimic Mind				KEY:Mimic Mind ~ Body Snatcher			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:You may use conceal thoughts to create a false set of surface thoughts appropriate for the body you currently occupy.  If you succeed on a saving throw against an attempt to read your mind while under conceal thoughts, the intruder reads only the decoy thoughts.  While you do not need to specify the nature of these thoughts (although you may choose to do so), they will reflect what the prying party might expect to find were the body's normal mind in residence.  In addition, while under conceal thoughts, you may emulate the alignment of the subject for purposes of fooling abilities that detect alignment.	DESC:This extends to include false memories, foiling effects such as mind probe.|PRECLASS:1,Body Snatcher=5																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.44
Rapid Transfer			KEY:Rapid Transfer ~ Body Snatcher			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary								DESC:You manifest mind switch as a standard action instead of a full-round action.																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.44
Seal the Host			KEY:Seal the Host ~ Body Snatcher			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality										DESC:You learn to augment your mind switch power in a unique fashion, potentially sealing the subject's higher mind from taking control of your body.  You add the following augment to mind switch: If you spend 2 additional power points, the subject's higher mind may be sealed away when it arrives in your body.  If your mind switch is successful, the subject must make a second Will save or be dazed for as long as it remains in your body, similar to the brain lock power.  This is in addition to your traumatic transfer ability.																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.44
Mindleap Contingency		KEY:Mindleap Contingency ~ Body Snatcher		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:You unlock the ability to use a unique metapsionic effect known as a mindleap contingency.  Powers that specify a single target and can affect your current form can be made into mindleap contingent powers. A mindleap contingent power, once manifest, lies dormant, undetectable and undispellable, for up to five minutes (after which time it fades harmlessly), or until you leave your current body via mind switch (either to return to your original body or to possess another). Immediately after the switch occurs, the mindleap contingency triggers, and the linked power takes effect on the body you were in when you established the contingency. Any choices to be made about the effect must be made when the power is manifest, not when it triggers. Saving throws made against a mindleap contingent power suffer a -5 penalty due to the sudden shift in bodies. Using this ability is akin to using a metapsionic feat - you must expend your psionic focus when establishing a mindleap contingency, and establishing one increases the power's power point cost by 4.																									SOURCEPAGE:p.44
Greater Melding Exchange	KEY:Greater Melding Exchange ~ Body Snatcher	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:When you use your melding exchange ability, your draw far more knowledge from your target than usual. You may use the subject's ranks in Knowledge skills in place of your own, and you learns the command words or thoughts for any items the subject has (provided they were known to the subject). Additionally, as a standard action, you may expend your psionic focus to mentally "ask" your newfound memories one question, typically about the subject's past or personality. You learn the answer to that question to the best of the subject's knowledge. Asking about rote facts is often unnecessary, due to the granting of Knowledge ranks - this ability extends beyond the Knowledge skill.																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.45
Death Is Only the Beginning	KEY:Death Is Only the Beginning ~ Body Snatcher	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:Common folklore suggests that many people see their lives flash before their eyes just before they die. In some ways, this is literal truth for you, although you tend to see only opportunity. Immediately upon being reduced to -1 hit points or lower, or failing a saving throw against an effect that would kill you, you may expend your psionic focus to manifest true mind switch as an immediate action at the same manifester level you manifest mind switch. You may only target your killer with this effect (thus, if the killer is out of range, this ability is worthless), and the save DC is reduced by 4 due to the desperate nature of this technique. If successful, your mind switches places with your killer's just before dying. You suffer level loss as normal for losing your previous body after a true mind switch.  You may apply all your body snatcher class features (except seal the host) to any manifestation of true mind switch, even one made at the moment of death.

The mind arrow receives all the benefits normally applied to the mind blade, including the ability to use psychic strike, any enhancement bonus or weapon special abilities, or feats that apply to the mind blade, although any melee-specific options are non-functional while in mind arrow form. Ranged feats that apply to ranged attacks, such as Point-Blank Shot, apply to the mind arrow.
