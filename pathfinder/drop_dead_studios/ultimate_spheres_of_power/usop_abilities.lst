# Traditions determine the CAM (Casting Ability Modifier)

# General Drawbacks
# 15
Area Bound			SOURCEPAGE:p.15	CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display	DESC:You are mystically bonded to a single notable location such as a cave, large tree, spring, a magical laboratory or prominent stone formation and draw your magic from it. You must remain within a number of miles equal to your MSB to use your magic normally. Using magic outside this area requires you to attempt a concentration check (DC 20 + 1/2 the caster level) to produce the desired effect. Failure means time (and any spell points) are spent, but no effect happens. You may bond to a new site of the same general type with an 8 hour ritual.
Center Of Power		SOURCEPAGE:p.15	CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display	DESC:You have an obvious physical feature which is the source of your magical power. Whenever you cast, any creature observing you can clearly see that your magic originates from your center of power. If a critical hit is confirmed on you, your center is disrupted and you lose 1d4 spell points (if you have them) and are dazed for 1 round. A creature can also target your center of power with a called shot, which also causes a disruption. The center of power is considered a challenging shot (-10). At the GM’s discretion, certain kinds of physical restraint might also make spellcasting require a concentration check (DC 20 + caster level), depending on the nature of the center of power and the restraint. An undesirable polymorph effect may also produce the same results. You may not select this drawback if you possess the Focus Casting or Galvanized drawbacks.
Consciousness Linked	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display	DESC:Your effects are linked to you even after you spend a spell point to have them continue without concentration. If you fall asleep or unconscious, or are dazed, stunned, confused, reduced to animal intelligence, or otherwise unable to take coherent mental actions, all of your magical effects immediately end.
Coy Caster			SOURCEPAGE:p.15	CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display	DESC:Your magic is a fickle thing, or perhaps you are simply possessed of performance anxiety. If you attempt to use magic while you know you are being observed, you must attempt a concentration check (DC 15 + 1/2 the caster level) to produce the desired effect. Failure means time (and any spell points) are spent, but no effect happens. If you believe you are hidden or alone, even if you are not, you may use magic normally.
Diagram Magic		SOURCEPAGE:p.16	CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display	DESC:In order to perform any magical effect, either you or your target must be entirely contained within the boundaries of a special diagram. Creating this diagram requires a full-round action for every 5-foot square contained within the diagram. Once the circle has been drawn, attempt a Spellcraft check as part of the full-round action to draw the final part of the circle against DC 15 + the maximum caster level of any effect to be performed within the circle to determine if it was done correctly. You may take 10 on this check even if in combat or stressed. You can increase the speed at which you draw the diagram but at greater risk of making a mistake. Doing so prevents you from taking 10 on the check, and for every step by which you reduce the time required to draw the diagram, increase the spellcraft DC by +5 to a maximum of +20 to draw the circle as a free action. The diagram need not be drawn with any special materials, and can be done with sprinkled salt, paint, blood, a finger in sand, or anything else that may be on hand so long as it is clearly visible. Permanent portable diagrams are usually not possible (as any scuff to the diagram disrupts the magic), but a diagram may be made out of fixed, permanent material such as metal. If a diagram is disrupted (any amount of damage dealt to the surface it is carved upon, or sufficient force from water, wind, or any other effect that might disperse the material the diagram was created with) then any magic currently being maintained by concentration via the diagram immediately ends, and no further magic may be used until a new circle is drawn. Spells and effects created by magic within the diagram (including summoned creatures) never disrupt it even if they would otherwise. This counts as 2 drawbacks when determining boons and bonus spell points.
Draining Casting		SOURCEPAGE:p.16	CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display	DESC:Using magic saps your lifeforce. Whenever you spend one or more spell points you are dealt 1 point of nonlethal damage which cannot be avoided by nonlethal damage immunity, reduced by damage reduction, and cannot be healed through any means except rest (a full night’s rest heals all nonlethal damage caused by this drawback at once). This nonlethal damage increases by 1 point for every 5 caster levels.
Emotional Casting		SOURCEPAGE:p.16	CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display	DESC:Your magic requires heightened emotional states of mind to use. When subject to a non-harmless effect that invokes an emotion (such as fear effects, demoralization, spells with the emotion descriptor, or (charms) such as Fear or Hostility) you are unable to use magic. You may use the metamagic feat Logical Spell to overcome this drawback.
Extended Casting		SOURCEPAGE:p.16	CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display	DESC:Your magic takes longer to use than normal. When using an ability gained from a sphere or talent, increase the casting time by one step: swift and immediate actions become move actions, move actions become standard actions, standard actions become full-round actions, full-round actions take 1 round to complete, and 1-round actions take 1 minute to complete. This drawback counts as 2 drawbacks when determining boons and bonus spell points. You may take this drawback twice. If taken twice, your casting takes a minimum of 1 minute to perform, regardless of the sphere effect being used. Taking this drawback twice grants a total of 4 drawbacks when determining boons and bonus spell points.
Fey-Infused Magic		SOURCEPAGE:p.16	CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display	DESC:Your magic is intrinsically linked to the realm of Faerie and shares its inhabitants aversion to iron. Any creature wearing light armor consisting of cold iron, steel or iron gains a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against sphere effects originating from you. Wearing medium armor increases this bonus to +2 and wearing heavy armor increases it to +3. Wielding a weapon made of cold iron increases this bonus by +1. When a target under the effects of one of your sphere abilities takes damage from iron or steel weapons, that target is treated as if it had been affected by the Counterspell feat, with a magic skill check equal to 10 +1/4th the damage dealt. This Counterspell is applied at the beginning of that creature’s turn, adding together all damage suffered from applicable sources since the beginning of its last turn, and ignores all effects that do not have the Fey-Infused Magic drawback. If the target is struck by a weapon made out of cold iron, the Counterspell is capable of dispelling one additional sphere effect per 5 points of base attack bonus that the attacker possesses.
Focus Casting		SOURCEPAGE:p.16	CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display	DESC:Your magic requires you to use an item such as a wand, holy symbol, ring, or staff to create magic. The focus must be wielded or equipped to be used (for example, a wand must be held, a ring must be equipped in a ring slot, etc.) Using magic without your focus requires you to attempt a concentration check (DC 20 + 1/2 the caster level) to produce the desired effect. Failure means time (and any spell points) are spent, but no effect happens. If a focus is lost, stolen, or broken, the caster must create a new focus by securing the necessary item and spending 8 hours bonding with it. At the GM’s discretion, however, another caster’s focus may be used instead. If you are carrying your focus when subject to a polymorph effect that would normally meld your equipment into your new form, your focus melds into your body as well, causing this drawback to function as the center of power drawback for the duration of the effect. You may not select this drawback if you possess the Center Of Power or Galvanized drawbacks.
Galvanized			SOURCEPAGE:p.16	CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display	DESC:Your magic was forged by war, and is integrated with your fighting abilities. To use or concentrate on your abilities, you must be wielding a martial or exotic weapon with at least some metal components (even some metal decorations on a wooden weapon are sufficient). You must be able to attack with the weapon (it cannot be tied down or otherwise unusable), and you must have proficiency with it. The weapon itself does not need to have any special abilities, but cannot have the broken condition. Being disarmed or having the weapon sundered counters any sphere abilities you are casting or maintaining. If a polymorph spell causes the weapon to become part of your body you lose your abilities, unless you can still attack with the weapon somehow. You can still switch between weapons while maintaining sphere abilities. You may not select this drawback if you possess the Center Of Power or Focus Casting drawbacks.
Magical Signs		SOURCEPAGE:p.17	CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display	DESC:Your magic is accompanied by tell-tale signs; for example, your body glows brightly, the sound of tortured souls shriek as you cast, a deep chill affects all nearby creatures, etc. Using magic automatically breaks stealth, and whenever you use magic all creatures within 60 feet who are observing you are considered to have automatically succeeded at a Spellcraft check to know which sphere effect, talents, and casting tradition you used. You may not select this drawback if you possess the Witchmarked drawback.
Material Casting		SOURCEPAGE:p.17	CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display	DESC:Your magic requires the expenditure of specific materials: precious metals, rare components, etc. The exact nature of this material should be worked out with the GM, but as a rule of thumb, this should cost a silver piece worth of materials per caster level per ability used. A player who does not want to track the cost of such material components can instead simply spend 10 gp per caster level per month on components, which is assumed to cover his costs for spells cast and research performed. You must possess a spell component pouch or otherwise have access to your components to use your magic. The gp cost of materials listed in this drawback are certainly not the only metric that can be used to reflect the role of magic materials in a setting, and GMs are encouraged to consider what role magic materials might play in their game. Perhaps magic in one world requires a pearl to use per spell point, and players must track how many pearls they possess. Perhaps magic is fueled by a rare mineral, the buying and selling of which is heavily regulated by powerful kings, merchants, and other world powers; in such a world, Material Casting might even be worth two drawbacks to reflect its rare usage.
Mental Focus		SOURCEPAGE:p.17	CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display	DESC:Your magic requires you to have a focus that is not always possible to achieve. You normally have focus, but lose it whenever you fail a save versus mind-affecting magic, have a critical hit confirmed on you, or a condition causes you to lose the ability to concentrate (such as being nauseated or helpless or failing a forced concentration check such as from being entangled). Using magic without your mental focus requires you to attempt a concentration check (DC 20 + 1/2 caster level) to produce the desired effect. Failure means time (and any spell points) are spent, but no effect happens. If focus is lost, the caster can refocus by meditating as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
Narcoleptic Casting	SOURCEPAGE:p.17	CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display	DESC:Your magic has a pacifying effect that can lull you to sleep. At the end of any round in which you spend 1 or more spell points you must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw with a DC of 10 + 1/2 your magic skill bonus (minimum DC 11) or fall asleep standing up for 1 round. Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature without dealing damage is a standard action (an application of the aid another action). Creatures immune to sleep cannot gain this drawback; if a creature later becomes immune to sleep after gaining this drawback, they must immediately retrain it for another drawback or lose it, recalculating their spell points as appropriate. This counts as 2 drawbacks when determining the number of spell points gained.
Painful Magic		SOURCEPAGE:p.17	CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display	DESC:Your magic debilitates you the more you rely on it. Whenever you spend one or more spell points, you must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the ability’s caster level) or be sickened for 1 round. If you fail this save while already sickened, you are instead nauseated for 1 round. If you fail this save while nauseated, increase the duration of the nauseated condition by 1 round. Creatures immune to the sickened condition cannot take this drawback. Prepared Caster You must prepare your magic before you can use it. After resting to regain spell points, you must assign each of your spell points to a sphere you possess. You cannot spend more spell points in a given sphere in a day than you have assigned to that sphere. Class features and feats that use spell points (such as the Counterspell feat) are considered a single unified ‘sphere’ for this purpose.
Rigorous Concentration	SOURCEPAGE:p.17	CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display	DESC:Your magic requires intense amounts of concentration to use. When attempting a concentration check (such as to cast defensively or while taking damage), the DC increases by +10. You may increase the casting time by one step to take extra time focusing and negate this penalty.
Skilled Casting		SOURCEPAGE:p.17	CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display	DESC:You must create your magic through singing, drawing, or performing some other activity. Your magic is tied to a particular Perform, Profession, or Craft skill (although with GM permission another skill may be substituted). You must succeed at a skill check to use any sphere ability. The DC of this skill check is 15 + the ability’s caster level. For every 2 points by which this skill check falls short of this DC, the ability manifests at -1 caster level. If this reduces the ability to a caster level below 0, the manifested ability fails and any spell points used are lost. A caster with Skilled Casting must be able to perform their skill to use their magic, which is similar to but not the same as possessing other drawbacks. For example, a caster who must draw to create magic must have at least one hand free, although unless he also possesses Somatic Casting he may do so while wearing any armor without a chance of arcane spell failure. Likewise, a caster who uses music to create magic must be able to speak, but unless he also possesses Verbal Casting he can do so by whispering and thus not automatically break stealth. At the GM’s discretion, this drawback may count as two drawbacks if the skill involved requires bulky equipment or the use of both hands (for example, the Perform (strings) skill, or Craft (stonework)).
Somatic Casting		SOURCEPAGE:p.18	CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display	DESC:You must gesture to cast spells—a process that requires you to have at least 1 hand unoccupied. When using magic, you cannot wear armor heavier than light without incurring a chance of arcane spell failure. You may select this drawback twice. If taken a second time, you cannot wear any armor or use a shield without incurring a chance of arcane spell failure. Note: With GM permission, it is possible to modify this drawback so that, when taken once, the caster may wear either light or medium armor but cannot use a shield without incurring a chance of arcane spell failure, mimicking the core bloodrager.
Terrain Casting		SOURCEPAGE:p.18	CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display	DESC:Your magic draws upon the primal energy and nutrients of the terrain. Whenever you use a sphere talent or ability you must either spend an additional spell point or increase your casting time by one step, else your magic drains and corrupts your space and all adjacent squares. Terrain that has been blighted in such a manner prevents those who possess the Terrain Casting drawback from using sphere talents or abilities as if it were a dead magic zone. Areas that have had its nutrients drained are affected in different ways depending upon location (water may turn brackish or stagnant, while soil may become barren or salted); regardless of location, blighted areas will generally heal naturally after a year.
Verbal Casting		SOURCEPAGE:p.18	CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display	DESC:You must speak in a loud, clear voice to cast spells. Using magic alerts all nearby hearing creatures to your presence and location, effectively breaking stealth. You cannot cast in an area of magical silence, or in any other situation where you are unable to speak clearly. Wild Magic Your magic is not entirely stable and can result in a variety of unwanted effects. You have a base wild magic chance of 10% (whenever you cast a spell or magical sphere ability, you have a 10% chance of activating a wild magic event). When you activate a wild magic event, roll as if you had activated a rod of wonder, then add that effect to those you produce with your magic. GMs may always use their own wild magic tables to determine the nature of a wild magic event.
Witchmarked			SOURCEPAGE:p.18	CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display	DESC:Some aspect of your visage is a dead giveaway about your magical nature. This could be any purely cosmetic modification or sensation that is hard to hide such as a vestigial tail (or tails), glowing eyes, an aura visible to the naked eye or the stench of death clinging to you. The intensity of this trait grows proportional to your power. Anyone who sees you may attempt a Knowledge (arcana) check (DC 20 - your MSB, minimum DC 0) to learn your magic skill bonus, caster level and what base magic spheres you possess. You may attempt to hide your witchmark trait, but doing so requires a successful Disguise check (DC 10 + your MSB, roll is hidden). Alternatively, if attempting to hide your witchmark as part of a more elaborate disguise, this gives a penalty to that Disguise check equal to your MSB. Using an illusion, shapechange, or other magical disguise to hide your witchmark automatically succeeds, but any use of magic that does not explicitly hide your witchmark instead immediately reveals your witchmark to all observers. You may not select this drawback if you possess the Magical Signs drawback.


# Sphere -Specific Drawbacks

# Alteration
Beast Soul				SOURCEPAGE:p.18	KEY:Beast Soul			CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display.Alteration	DESC:You cannot bestow the Blank Transformation, including through the Anthropomorphic Transformation talent. You must select a (transformation) talent with the bonus talent gained from this drawback.
Fleshwarper				SOURCEPAGE:p.18	KEY:Fleshwarper			CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display.Alteration	DESC:You may not target yourself with shapeshift. Incompatible: Lycanthropic
Lycanthropic			SOURCEPAGE:p.18	KEY:Lycanthropic			CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display.Alteration	DESC:You can only target yourself with your shapeshift ability. You cannot gain the Mass Alteration nor Ranged Alteration talents. Incompatible: Fleshwarper, Rebound
Rebound				SOURCEPAGE:p.19	KEY:Rebound				CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display.Alteration	DESC:If an unwilling creature succeeds on a save to resist your shapeshift effect, you must save against the same effect at the same DC. On a failed save, you receive all the traits and forms you would have granted the target. This effect lasts for 1d4 rounds. You must select Animal Mind or Twisted Shapeshift with the bonus talent gained from this drawback. Incompatible: Lycanthropic
Transformative Brew		SOURCEPAGE:p.19	KEY:Transformative Brew		CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display.Alteration	DESC:You must select the Instill Shapeshift talent with the bonus talent granted by this drawback, and you can only use your Alteration sphere abilities through this talent.
Unnatural Transformation	SOURCEPAGE:p.19	KEY:Unnatural Transformation	CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display.Alteration	DESC:Creatures under the effect of your shapeshift bear irrepressible signs (coloration, visual aura, glowing sigil or similar) of their true identity. Your shapeshift never grants a bonus to Disguise checks due to the obviously unnatural nature of the transformation. When touched by silver (such as being hit with a silver weapon or even touched by a silver piece) a creature under the effect of your shapeshift must attempt a Will save with a DC equal 5 + any damage dealt or have the shapeshift end immediately.

# Blood
Hemokinetic			SOURCEPAGE:p.19	KEY:Hemokinetic		CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display.Blood	DESC:You cannot use blood control. You must select the Hemokinesis talent with the bonus talent from this drawback. You may use the blood arc option on creatures within blood control range (and may take the Improved Range talent) even when they are not under your blood control. You may use the Hemokinesis options dependant on the Manipulate Alchemy and Manipulate Health talents, but only when the necessary ability has been used by another creature. Incompatible: Limited Acceleration, Self-controlled
Humors			SOURCEPAGE:p.19	KEY:Humors			CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display.Blood	DESC:You must select the Instill Blood Control talent with the bonus talent granted by this drawback, and you can only use your Blood sphere abilities through this talent. Limited Acceleration Choose either (quicken) or (still). You can only use this ability and cannot use abilities of the other type. Incompatible: Hemokinetic
Self-Controlled		SOURCEPAGE:p.19	KEY:Self-Controlled	CATEGORY:Sphere Drawback	TYPE:Drawback.Display.Blood	DESC:You may only target yourself with blood control. You must select the Self Control talent with the bonus talent from this drawback. Incompatible: Hemokinetic


# Lots more...


# Boons (p.28)
Atmoturgy			SOURCEPAGE:p.28	CATEGORY:Sphere Boon	TYPE:Boon.Display	DESC:Choose a weather category (Aridity, Cold, Heat, Precipitation, or Wind). While in weather of this type of severity level 3 or higher, you gain a +1 competence bonus to your caster level. At severity level 6 or higher, this bonus becomes +2.
Bound Creature		SOURCEPAGE:p.28	CATEGORY:Sphere Boon	TYPE:Boon.Display	DESC:Your magic is tied to a magical creature, who shares essence and power with you. You gain the Conjuration sphere (or the Extra Companion talent if you already possess the Conjuration sphere), and a companion who serves as the source of your power. Your companion can possess companion archetypes and gain (form) talents as a normal companion, but does not gain the extraplanar subtype; it cannot be summoned, dismissed, or banished, and costs no spell points to use. (Form) talents that require the expenditure of spell points when a companion is summoned can be activated by spending those points after you rest to regain spell points, in which case the benefit lasts until the next time you rest to regain spell points. Bound creatures cannot benefit from talents gained from implements or that you do not permanently possess. You do not suffer a chance of failure from the Focus Casting drawback so long as your bound creature is on the same plane as you and is within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level). If your bound creature dies, you suffer a chance of spell failure as outlined in the Focus Casting drawback until you gain another bound creature or bring the previous one back to life somehow. You cannot bond with a new creature for 30 days or until you gain another level, whichever comes first. A caster must possess the Focus Casting drawback to select this boon.
Deathful Magic		SOURCEPAGE:p.28	CATEGORY:Sphere Boon	TYPE:Boon.Display	DESC:The closer you are to death, the more powerful your magic. While you are at half hit points or less, you gain a +1 competence bonus to your caster level. While you are at 1/4th your total hit points or less, this competence bonus increases to +2.
Draw Magic			SOURCEPAGE:p.28	CATEGORY:Sphere Boon	TYPE:Boon.Display	DESC:You gain a +1 competence bonus to your caster level whenever at least 3 creatures under the effects of your sphere abilities are within 30 feet of you. This competence bonus increases to +2 if there are at least 6 such creatures within 30 feet.
Drawback Feat		SOURCEPAGE:p.28	CATEGORY:Sphere Boon	TYPE:Boon.Display	DESC:You gain a (drawback) feat, chosen when this casting tradition is created.
Easy Focus			SOURCEPAGE:p.28	CATEGORY:Sphere Boon	TYPE:Boon.Display	DESC:When maintaining a sphere ability through concentration, effects that normally require a standard action to concentrate on only require a move action for you. This does not decrease the sphere ability’s casting time, only the action used to maintain concentration.
Embodiment			SOURCEPAGE:p.28	CATEGORY:Sphere Boon	TYPE:Boon.Display	DESC:You have come to mentally embody some substance in spirit. Select some substance to which you have a mental or philosophical kinship. Magic that can only affect that substance or work through that substance can still affect you if you wish to be so affected. This does not allow you to use talents or abilities that only affect items of a particular nature on yourself, but allows you to use abilities that could reasonably apply to you apart from a material limitation. For instance, you could not use the Nature sphere to use Towering Growth on yourself via Embodiment (trees), but you could use Limited Telekinesis (ice) to move yourself via Embodiment (ice). Similarly, having Embodiment (trees) would allow another with Limited Warp (trees) to teleport to your location if you knew they wished to and allowed it to happen.
Empowered Abilities	SOURCEPAGE:p.28	CATEGORY:Sphere Boon	TYPE:Boon.Display	DESC:Your magic grows in strength the more you use it. While your current number of spell points is half your total spell points or less, you gain a +1 competence bonus to your caster level. While your current number of spell points is 0, the competence bonus to your caster level becomes +2.
Fortified Casting		SOURCEPAGE:p.28	CATEGORY:Sphere Boon	TYPE:Boon.Display	DESC:You may use your Constitution as your casting ability modifier if it is higher than your usual casting ability modifier. You must possess the Draining Casting drawback to select this boon. Metamagic Expert Your sphere abilities are cast with a +1 competence bonus to caster level whenever you augment it with a metamagic feat.
Overcharge			SOURCEPAGE:p.28	CATEGORY:Sphere Boon	TYPE:Boon.Display	DESC:You may overcharge your magic, giving yourself great power at the cost of your own strength. Whenever you use a sphere ability, you may give yourself a +2 competence bonus to your caster level for that ability, but you become fatigued afterward. If you are already fatigued, you become exhausted. If you are exhausted, you collapse to the ground unconscious for 1d4 rounds. Creatures immune to fatigue cannot benefit from this boon.
Overwhelming Power	SOURCEPAGE:p.28	CATEGORY:Sphere Boon	TYPE:Boon.Display	DESC:Creatures under the effects of at least 1 of your sphere abilities suffer a -1 penalty to their saves against your other sphere abilities. This penalty increases to -2 if they are under the effects of at least 3 of your sphere abilities.
Sanguine Empowerment	SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Sphere Boon	TYPE:Boon.Display	DESC:At the beginning of your turn when you take damage from an ongoing bleed effect, you gain a +1 competence bonus to your caster level until the start of your next turn.
Virtuoso			SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Sphere Boon	TYPE:Boon.Display	DESC:Your magic is blended into your performance making it more difficult to identify. Observers must attempt a Perception or Sense Motive check opposed by your Skilled Casting check to realize that you are even invoking magic. You must possess the Skilled Casting drawback to select this boon, and cannot possess drawbacks such as Center of Power, Magical Signs, or Witchmarked that specifically reveal the nature of your casting.
Wild Will			SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Sphere Boon	TYPE:Boon.Display	DESC:Choose an environment from the ranger’s favored terrain list. Animals, vermin, and magical beasts commonly found in your selected environment are especially susceptible to your magic; your talents are treated as 2 caster levels higher when affecting these creatures. Vermin common to these environments are treated as animals with an Intelligence score of 1 for the purposes of affecting them with your mind-affecting talents. This boon may be taken multiple times, each time using a different environmental setting.
