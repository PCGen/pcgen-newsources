For this to be a crime, you were not content to keep your heresy to yourself. You tried to sway others. Likely you were captured by the famed witch hunter Sir Balin of Karfeld. The last thing he said to you was: "Mitra may forgive you yet for your lies. Talingarde will not." If only you could get a chance at revenge!. Punishment: Death by burning.

BONUS:SAVE|Will|1|TYPE=Trait																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.93
