Create Spawn (Su) A humanoid slain by an apparition be- comes an apparition itself in 1d4 rounds. Spawn so created are less powerful than typical apparitions, and suffer a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks. They also receive -2 hp per HD, and a -2 penalty to the Will save DC of their spectral strangulation ability. Spawn are under the command of the apparition that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which point they lose their spawn penalties and become full-fledged and free-willed apparitions. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

AAA	KEY:Apparition ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ApparitionRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Spectral Strangulation (Su) An apparition attacks an opponent by implanting a suggestion in the victim's mind, convincing it that it is being strangled by the apparition's bony claws. The apparition must be on the same plane as the target creature to use this ability.  The target of the spectral strangulation feels the bony, claw-like fingers of the apparition at its throat-even through armor. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Will save to disbelieve the suggestion. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same apparition's suggestion for one day.  On a failed save, the victim must immediately succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or die from fright due to heart failure. If the Fortitude save succeeds, the victim acts as if affected by a fear spell for 1d4 rounds. A creature protected by magic circle against evil or protection from evil cannot be affected by an apparition's spectral strangulation. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DCs are Charismabased.

The arcanoplasm cannot mimic spells a 7th-level arcane caster could not normally cast (i.e., it cannot mimic divine spells, or arcane spells of 5th level or higher). The save DC is Charisma-based.  Due to their innately magical nature, an arcanoplasm adds its Constitution modifier in addition to its Charisma modifier to all concentration checks to cast a spell using arcane spell mimicry.

Sonic Screech (Su) A mobat can blast an ear-splitting screech that affects all creatures (except other mobats) within a 20-ft. radius. The screech stuns any creature in the area for 1d3 rounds if it fails a DC 15 Will save. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. Whether or not the save succeeds an affected creature is immune to the same mobat's screech for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Bedlam
DESC:This creature has no set form. Before your eyes it seems to shift from a vaguely humanoid form with yellow eyes and no other discernible facial features to a swirling mass of grayish-black crackling matter. In its latter form, blue-gray energy arcs and dances through its form, making it resemble a thundercloud shot through with lightning. It seems to constantly alter its form, as if it has no control over it.

AAA	KEY:Bedlam ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BedlamRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Chaos Burst (Su): Once per round as a standard action, a bedlam can release a burst of crackling gray energy in a 20-foot radius around itself. Lawful creatures caught in the area take 5d8 points of damage and are staggered for 1d6 rounds. Non-lawful and non-chaotic creatures take 3d8 points of damage, but are not staggered. A successful DC 18 Will save halves the damage and negates the staggered effect. Chaotic-aligned creatures are immune to this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:Bedlam ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BedlamRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Chaotic Resonance (Su): A bedlam emanates an aura of pure chaos; an invisible and ever-changing ring of chaotic energy. This aura disrupts spells and magic items (except those of a chaotic nature) used within 20 feet of the bedlam.  Spellcasters in the area must make a successful DC 18 caster level check each time they attempt to cast a spell. If the check fails, the spell fizzles away just as if it had been cast. Any magic item used within this area must make a successful DC 18 Fortitude save or lose its magical properties for that round.  A new save must be made each round the item remains within the area. These DCs are Constitution-based. Spells with the chaotic descriptor that are cast within this area function as if they were empowered (as by the Empower Spell feat). Chaotically-aligned weapons (anarchic weapons) deal an additional +1d6 points of chaotic damage while in this aura (e.g., an anarchic weapon deals 3d6 total points of chaotic damage while in this aura). Lawful-aligned weapons are unaffected by this aura and also bypass the bedlam's damage reduction.

AAA	KEY:Bedlam ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BedlamRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Detect Law (Su): A bedlam can continuously detect law as the spell (caster level 10th), though there is no chance of it becoming stunned by overwhelming lawful auras. It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.

Since the effect stems from the vibrations set up in a victim's body and not from the clicking noise itself, silence offers no protection against this attack.

AAA	KEY:Bloodsuckle ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BloodsuckleRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Blood Drain (Ex) A bloodsuckle that grapples a foe can drain blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round that the hold is maintained. Once it has dealt 8 points of Constitution damage, it releases victim so it can use it again later as a food source. Bloodsuckles never kill those they have transformed into hosts unless they are extremely hungry.

AAA	KEY:Bloodsuckle ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BloodsuckleRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Create Host (Ex) A bloodsuckle that strikes a living target with a tendril injects a special poison sap into the victim that requires a DC 18 Will save, or the victim is transformed into a host. This acts as a dominate monster spell (caster level 8th) with no limit on its duration. Immunity or resistance to poison applies normally to this sap. The save DC is Constitutionbased.  A victim that becomes a host returns to the plant whenever it calls. It is normally used by the bloodsuckle for feeding purposes, but if the plant comes under attack may be summoned for defense. A host with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher that is commanded to act in a manner inconsistent with its alignment (such as attacking allies) is allowed another Will save with a +4 bonus to break the bloodsuckle's control.

AAA	KEY:Bloodsuckle ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BloodsuckleRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Host Sense (Ex) A bloodsuckle automatically senses the location of any hosts within 100 feet.

AAA	KEY:Bloodsuckle ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BloodsuckleRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Seed (Ex) Once per month, a bloodsuckle can generate a walnut-sized seed that it implants in a host's body. The host wanders off and 1d4 days later, the seed breaks open growing a new bloodsuckle inside the host. Each day a host remains implanted with this seed, it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage.  When its Constitution reaches 0, the host dies and a new bloodsuckle erupts from the corpse and takes root. A remove disease spell destroys the seedling.

AAA	KEY:Bloodsuckle ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BloodsuckleRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Summon Host (Ex) As free action, a bloodsuckle can generate a high-pitched whine that only its hosts can hear.  A host that hears this call proceeds immediately at its highest rate of speed and in the most direct route toward the plant.  The whine can be heard by a host within 2 miles of the bloodsuckle.

AAA	KEY:BloodyBones ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BloodyBonesRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Tendril (Ex) A bloody bones can fire up to 4 sinewy tendrils from its body at a time, launching them to a range of 30 feet. A bloody bones's attacks with its tendrils resolve as ranged touch attacks. These tendrils are quite strong (10 hp) but can be severed with a slashing weapon or a sunder combat maneuver. Attacking a bloody bones's tendril does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the tendril is currently wrapped around a target, the bloody bones takes a -4 penalty to CMD to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a tendril deals no damage to a bloody bones.

Creatures afflicted with bog rot do not heal naturally and gain only one-half benefit from magical healing until the disease is cured. Unlike normal diseases, bog rot continues until the victim reaches Constitution 0 (and dies) or receives a remove disease spell or similar magic. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:Bogeyman ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BogeymanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Bump in the Night (Su): A bogeyman can create a phantasmagoric image in the mind of a single creature within 200 feet. Such images cause the victim to see and hear things that are not really there or to see and hear things differently than they actually are. Things such as following footsteps, bumps and thumps from an unknown source, a gnarled tree with outstretched limbs scratching on a window or reaching for someone, the idea that someone or something is lurking around the corner, in the closet, or under the bed, and so on. A creature affected by the images takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage if it fails a DC 19 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus from the bogeyman's Ability Focus feat. The bogeyman can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. A creature who drops to Wisdom 0 is affected as if by an insanity spell (caster level 8th) until at least 1 point of Wisdom is restored.

AAA	KEY:Bogeyman ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BogeymanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Frighten (Su): A living creature within 60 feet that views a bogeyman must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or stand frozen in fear for 1d6+2 rounds. Such a creature is not helpless, but cannot take any action. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same bogeyman's frighten ability for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:Bogeyman ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BogeymanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Shadow Shift (Su): A bogeyman has the ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a dimension door spell. The limitation is that the magical transport must begin and end in an area with at least some shadow. A bogeyman can shift up to a total of 80 feet each day in this way; this may be a single jump of 80 feet or multiple jumps of 10 feet each. This amount can be split among many jumps, but each one, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot increment.

AAA	KEY:Boggart ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoggartRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Change Shape (Su) A boggart's natural form is that of a small humanoid (resembling a young gnome, halfling, or goblin). It has one other form: that of a small, immature will-o'-wisp. In humanoid form, a boggart assumes the same appearance and traits of its form, much as a lycanthrope would. In humanoid form, a boggart retains all of its special attacks and special qualities. The second form is that of a will-o- 'wisp. In this form, a boggart is nearly indistinguishable from a normal willo'-wisp, but a DC 18 Knowledge (dungeoneering) or Perception check reveals that the boggart is in fact smaller and brighter. A boggart can assume either form as a standard action, though it cannot maintain either one for longer than 1 minute (10 rounds). A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the boggart revert to its true natural form when slain. A true seeing spell reveals the boggart's natural form if it is in will-o'-wisp form.

AAA	KEY:Boggart ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoggartRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Confusion (Su) Once per day, as a full-round action, a boggart can unleash a screech that confuses all those hearing it within 30 ft. of the boggart. The confusion lasts for 6 rounds. An affected creature can make a DC 15 Will save to negate the effects. Each additional boggart within 10 feet that joins the screeching increases the save DC by +1. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:Boggart ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoggartRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Detect Thoughts (Su) A boggart can continuously detect thoughts as the spell (caster level 8th). It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.

AAA	KEY:Boggart ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoggartRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Electricity (Su) A boggart delivers 2d6 points of electricity damage with a successful slam attack (DC 15 Fortitude for half). The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:Boggart ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoggartRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Electrical Discharge (Su): Once every other round as a standard action, a boggart can discharge a bolt of electricity in a 10-foot line. The bolt deals 2d6 points of electricity damage (DC 15 Reflex save for half). The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:Boggart ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoggartRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Feed (Su) When a boggart slays a humanoid opponent, it can feed on the corpse, devouring both flesh and life force, as a full-round action. Feeding destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic. A boggart advances in Hit Dice by consuming corpses in this fashion. For every three suitable corpses a boggart devours, it gains 1 Hit Die, and its Strength, Constitution, and natural armor increase by +1. Its attack bonus and saves improve as normal for an aberration of its Hit Dice, and it gains skill ranks, feats, and ability score improvements normally. The boggart only advances by consuming the corpses of creatures whose Hit Dice or levels are equal to or greater than its own current total. A boggart that reaches 9 Hit Dice through feeding immediately becomes a will-o'-wisp upon completion of the act.

AAA	KEY:Boggart ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoggartRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Magic (Ex) Boggarts are immune to most spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, except magic missile, protection from evil, magic circle against evil, and maze.

These creatures fight as skeletons (see Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary), though their forms and structures do not necessarily have to resemble humanoids (or anything remotely humanoid).

Bonestripping (Ex) A bone cobbler can rapidly strip all the flesh from a Medium creature in 3 minutes using its claws and hammers. For each size category larger than Medium a corpse is, add 1 minute to the time it takes the bone cobbler to strip the corpse. For each size category smaller than Medium a corpse is, reduce the time by 1 minute (to a minimum of 1 minute). Once stripped, the bone cobbler devours the flesh and collects the victim's bones to use in its "sculptures". A creature slain in this manner can only be brought back to life by a miracle, wish, or true resurrection spell.

Aversion to Daylight (Ex) Boneneedles shun all light. If exposed to natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell), they take a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.

AAA	KEY:GreaterBoneneedle ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GreaterBoneneedleRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Poison (Ex) The bite of a boneneedle secretes a thick, syrupy neurotoxin that destroys flesh and quickly breaks down bone. The chemical reaction causes the bones to weaken and become brittle. If the opponent fails his save against the poison's secondary effect, its bones weaken, and it takes an extra 2 points of damage from any crushing or bludgeoning attack until all Dexterity damage dealt by marrow poisoning is healed. Cumulative bites do not increase the amount of extra damage beyond 2 points An opponent reduced to Dexterity 0 dies as its bones become too brittle to support its weight thus causing its body to collapse in on itself. Creatures without bone structures, such as constructs (except those crafted from bone), oozes, and plants, are immune to the effects of marrow poisoning.  Bone Needle Poison; Sting-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; effect 1d4 Dex; secondary effect: target takes an extra 2 points of damage from crushing or bludgeoning attacks until all Dex damage is healed; cure 1 save.

Immunity to Magic (Ex) A brass man is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows a brass man (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw.  A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the brass man and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the brass man to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A brass man gets no saving throw against fire effects.

If the creature is destroyed by channeled positive energy, it cannot reanimate. If a cleric casts gentle repose on the cadaver when it is reduced to 0 hit points, it cannot reanimate. A bless spell delays the reanimation, causing the creature to regain hit points at half the normal rate (i.e. 1 hit point every other round).

Immunity to Magic (Ex) A caryatid column is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A transmute rock to mud spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to a caryatid column, with no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost hit points.  A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the column's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round.

Shatter Weapons (Ex) Whenever a character strikes a caryatid column with a weapon (magical or nonmagical), the weapon must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or shatter into pieces. A magic weapon uses its own save bonus or that of the wielder, whichever is higher. If the weapon breaks, the caryatid column takes no damage from the attack.

A creature struck by a cave fisher's filament becomes attached to the sticky thread.  As a standard action, a creature can rip the filament free with a DC 20 Strength check. A caught creature can also attempt to escape a filament by making a DC 25 Escape Artist check. A filament is AC 14 (touch 12), has 5 hit points, and has DR 15/slashing.

AAA	KEY:CerebralStalker ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CerebralStalkerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Cocoon (Ex) Once per round as a standard action, and no more than three times per day, a cerebral stalker can cocoon a grappled foe by shooting sticky webbing from its body. The webs cover as much of the victim as possible, excluding the top of the victim's head, its eyes, and its nose. The webs remain attached to the cerebral stalker's body and stretch from just under its arms to its knees. A cocooned victim is anchored to the cerebral stalker and cannot move. The cocooned creature can, as a standard action, break free with a successful DC 20 Strength check or DC 16 Escape Artist check. The webbing has 8 hit points. Note the victim is still grappled even if it breaks the webbing and must succeed at a grapple check to get completely free of the cerebral stalker's grasp. The check DCs are Constitution-based and the Strength check includes a +4 racial bonus. Once a victim is cocooned, the cerebral stalker can use its sink ability.

AAA	KEY:CerebralStalker ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CerebralStalkerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Consume Brain (Ex) Once it has its victim underground, the cerebral stalker begins gnawing on the victim's head, rapidly chewing through bone and tissue, dealing 2d8+4 points of damage each round. When the victim dies, the cerebral stalker has reached its goal-the victim's brain, which it promptly devours. A victim slain in this manner is ejected from the ground and becomes a zombie (see below).

AAA	KEY:CerebralStalker ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CerebralStalkerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Create Zombie (Su): A creature whose brain is devoured by a cerebral stalker is ejected from the ground and animates as a zombie in 1d4 rounds. Zombies created in this manner are not under the control of the cerebral stalker.

AAA	KEY:CerebralStalker ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CerebralStalkerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Earth Glide (Ex) A cerebral stalker can glide through any sort of natural earth or stone as easily as a fish swims through water.  Its gliding leaves no sign of its passage or hint of its presence to creatures that don't possess tremorsense.

AAA	KEY:CerebralStalker ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CerebralStalkerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Sink (Su) After cocooning a foe, the cerebral stalker begins sinking into the ground, taking the cocooned victim with it. It takes four full rounds for the stalker and foe to completely sink into the ground. In the first round, the creature sinks to its knees; in the second round to its waist; in the third round to its neck; and in the last round, both stalker and foe are completely underground.  Sinking is a move action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.  Creatures attempting to grab the cocooned victim and prevent the sinking must first break or burn the webbing (see above), and then succeed at a grapple check against the cerebral stalker. A dispel magic (or similar effect) cast on a sinking cerebral stalker paralyzes it (as if by a hold monster spell) for a number of rounds equal to the caster's level if the stalker fails a Fortitude save. The stalker can make a new save each round to negate the paralysis. The stalker and victim sink to a depth of 10 feet where the victim is placed in a stasis (similar to temporal stasis). The spot where the cerebral stalker and victim sunk radiates magic and can be detected normally. Spells such as locate object, discern location, scrying, and other divinatory magic reveals the entombed creature and stalker. A freedom spell cast on the spot where the stalker and victim sunk immediately frees the subject from the webbing and ejects both it and the stalker, who is stunned for 1 round, to the surface.

AAA	KEY:Chrystone ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ChrystoneRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Death Throes (Ex) When a chrystone is destroyed, it shatters, spraying razor-sharp fragments from its form. Creatures within 5 feet of the chrystone take 2d6 points of damage. A DC 12 Reflex saving throw halves the damage. A chrystone can prevent itself from shattering by making a DC 12 Will save as it is destroyed.

AAA	KEY:Chrystone ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ChrystoneRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:
Spell-like Abilities (Sp) Three times per day, a chrystone can use its stone shape to repair itself, healing 1d6 points of damage per use. This requires a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The save DC for the chrystone's color spray includes a +2 racial bonus.

AAA	KEY:Chrystone ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ChrystoneRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A chrystone is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A transmute rock to mud spell slows a chrystone (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost hit points.  A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the chrystone's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round.

AAA	KEY:Chrystone ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ChrystoneRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Shatter Weapons (Ex) Whenever a character strikes a chrystone with a weapon (magical or nonmagical), the weapon must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or shatter into pieces. A magic weapon uses its own save bonus or that of the wielder, whichever is higher. If the weapon breaks, the chrystone takes no damage from the attack. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

AAA	KEY:ChurchGrim ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ChurchGrimRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Howl (Su) The howl of a church grim causes any evil creature within its limited domain (its churchyard; see below) to make a successful DC 16 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. Good or neutral creatures are completely unaffected by the howl as long as they are not there to steal from the dead or attack the church. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be affected by the same church grim's howl for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:ChurchGrim ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ChurchGrimRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Know Alignment (Su) A church grim makes automatically knows the alignment of any creature that enters its churchyard. This ability can be dispelled, but the church grim can reactivate it the following round as a free action.  It cannot extend this ability beyond the limits of its domain, however.

AAA	KEY:ChurchGrim ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ChurchGrimRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Limited Domain (Ex) The realm of a church grim encompasses only the churchyard it defends; it can wander freely in its cemetery and any adjoining church grounds, but it cannot move beyond; it must stop at the boundary of consecrated land.

AAA	KEY:ChurchGrim ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ChurchGrimRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Rejuvenation (Su) It is difficult to destroy a church grim through simple combat. A slain church grim restores itself within 24 hours. Even the most powerful spells are often only temporary solutions. A church grim that would otherwise be destroyed returns to its churchyard with a successful level check (1d20 + the church grim's HD) against DC 16.  The only sure way to get rid of a church grim is to raze the church it protects and cast unhallow on the churchyard.  Soul Defender (Su) It is the sacred duty of a church grim to defend the bodies and souls of those buried in its churchyard. Any attempts to cast an animate dead or similar spell to create undead within the confines of an area guarded by a church grim requires the caster to make a successful DC 20 caster level check. If the check fails, the spell fizzles away just as if it had been cast. Whether the check succeeds or not, the caster incurs the full wrath of the church grim immediately.

AAA	KEY:ChurchGrim ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ChurchGrimRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Wisdom Damage (Su) The incorporeal bite of a church grim deals 1d6 points of holy damage and 1d4 points of Wisdom damage to the target. A successful DC 14 Fortitude save

Acid (Ex) A giant clam has a slow-acting acid that it uses to break down organic matter trapped in its interior. An engulfed creature takes 1d2 points of acid damage each round.

AAA	KEY:GiantClam ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GiantClamRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Engulf (Ex) As a standard action, a giant clam can attempt to pull a creature up to one size smaller than itself that is within reach into its interior. An opponent can make an attack of opportunity against the clam, but if it does so it is not entitled to a saving throw. An opponent that does not attempt an attack of opportunity must succeed on a DC 17 Reflex save or be pulled into the clam's interior. An engulfed creature is subject to the clam's acid, and is considered to be grappled and trapped within its body. The save DC is Strength-based. A giant clam can be forced open by making an opposed Strength check against the clam's Strength check. Otherwise, it opens on its own in 1d4 hours.

AAA	KEY:GiantClam ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GiantClamRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Camouflage (Ex) The rough shell of a giant clam is usually draped with barnacles, anemones, and bits of coral, which help it to blend in with its environment. Creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Perception check to notice a giant clam. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (any wateror sea-related skill) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the giant clam.

AAA	KEY:Clamor ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClamorRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Natural Invisibility (Su) As creatures of living sound, a clamor is naturally invisible, even when it attacks. This ability is inherent and is not subject to the invisibility purge spell.

AAA	KEY:Clamor ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClamorRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Sound Mimicry (Ex) A clamor can duplicate any sound it has ever encountered with perfect accuracy as a free action. It can use this ability to duplicate speech, music, or any other auditory phenomenon, although sounds with magical properties (such as power word spells) lose their magical effects when duplicated.

AAA	KEY:Clamor ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClamorRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Sonic Burst (Ex) A clamor can emit a massive onslaught of sonic energy as a full-round action that can be heard for miles in all directions. Any living creature within 100 feet of the clamor must make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d3 rounds. Furthermore, living creatures within 50 feet of the clamor must make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save or be permanently deafened. A restoration, wish, miracle, or remove blindness/deafness spell restores hearing and negates the stunning effect. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:Clamor ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClamorRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Speed of Sound (Ex): Once per day, a clamor can move at the speed of sound for a number of minutes equal to its Hit Dice. Its fly speed increases to 6,820 ft. (34,100 squares), but it cannot attack or use of any of its other abilities when moving this way.

AAA	KEY:Clamor ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClamorRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Sound-Related Vulnerabilities (Ex) Any magical silence effect or effect that creates a vacuum deals 3d6 points of damage to a clamor and forces it to make a successful Fortitude save (DC equal to 10 + spell level + spell caster's appropriate ability score modifier) or become panicked for 1 minute. In addition, the following spells can affect a clamor in unusual ways.  Ghost sound, major image, minor image, message, ventriloquism, whispering wind: These magically generated or altered sounds force a clamor to make a Will save (DC 10 + spell level + the caster's appropriate ability score modifier) or act as though affected by a confusion spell for a number of rounds equal to the caster's level.  Sculpt sound: If targeted directly at the clamor, this spell deals 1d4 points of damage per caster level. The clamor is allowed a Fortitude save for half damage. Alternately, a bard (and only a bard) using sculpt sound can attempt to completely control the actions of a clamor. The clamor is allowed an initial Fortitude save to negate the effect; if it fails, it is controlled as if by a dominate monster spell with a caster level equal to that of the bard's class level.  Shout, sound burst: These spells do no damage to a clamor, but force it to make a Will save or be affected as if by a charm monster spell with a caster level equal to that of the caster.

AAA	KEY:ClockworkBrainGear ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClockworkBrainGearRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Control Clockwork (Su) Any clockwork that comes within two miles of a brain gear immediately falls under that brain gear's control. If more than one brain gear attempts to control a clockwork (or if the clockwork is under the control of another brain gear or overseer), each gear must make an opposed Intelligence check; the winner gains control of that clockwork. When a clockwork moves more than 2 miles away from a brain gear, it continues to perform the last order given to it, but there is a 25% percent chance each hour that it ceases to function, collapsing into a pile of junk. If a brain gear later moves within two miles of the destroyed clockwork, the clockwork can reactivate if it has the self-repair ability. Otherwise, it remains destroyed. A brain gear in control of at least one clockwork can, as a free action once per round, use that clockwork to perceive the world through its senses (such as seeing the area surrounding the clockwork). This ability has a range of 2 miles. If a brain gear controls multiple clockworks, it can instantaneously jump from clockwork to clockwork, keeping tabs on all of its thralls and perceiving the world through their senses. A brain gear can switch control from one clockwork to another once per round as a free action. A brain gear uses this ability to give commands to its clockworks, allowing the usually mindless creatures to fight with highly coordinated tactics. Each clockwork is capable of receiving roughly 100 words worth of orders. Anything beyond that is too complicated for the clockwork to handle.

AAA	KEY:ClockworkBrainGear ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClockworkBrainGearRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Dream (Su) The brain gear has a limited ability to send psychic messages. Once per week, it can create an effect similar to a dream spell (caster level 10th). The brain gear can contact multiple creatures by designating a generic creature type, such as ogre or human. This designation affects every member of the target type within a 2-mile radius of the brain gear.

Normally, a brain gear can control only clockworks that are within two miles of its position. A brain gear can control an overseer that stays within 10 miles of its position. In addition, the overseer can act as a field commander for up to 20 HD worth of clockworks that are within 100 feet of its position.

AAA	KEY:ClockworkParasite ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClockworkParasiteRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Control Host (Su) By burrowing into the base of a corpse's skull and attaching itself with its pincers, a parasite clockwork can animate the creature (similar to an animate dead spell). The animated creature uses its own HD, base attack, saves, and hit points. It has an effective Wisdom of 10 and Charisma of 1. It does not have an Intelligence score. The host loses all skills, feats, class abilities, supernatural abilities, and spell-like abilities (including the ability to cast spells) it possessed in life. It retains its AC and any natural attacks it possessed, including proficiency with weapons. A host retains any proficiency with armor and shields it possessed while alive.  Spells such as detect undead or detect magic do not reveal the presence of the parasite or host. So long as the parasite clockwork remains in contact with the host, the control remains in effect.  A host brought to 0 or less hit points is destroyed, but can be repaired by the clockwork parasite using its self-repair ability (though this only works if the host is brought to 0 or less hit points; a host does not gain the self-repair ability of the parasite while "alive").

AAA	KEY:ClockworkParasite ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClockworkParasiteRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

Deceiving Death (Ex) In any round in which a coffer corpse is struck for 6 or more points of damage (whether the damage bypasses the creature's damage reduction or not), the creature slumps to the ground, seemingly destroyed. If it has fastened its death grip on a victim, it releases its hold when it falls. A DC 20 Sense Motive check sees through the ruse (necromancers gain a +2 competence bonus on this check).

AAA	KEY:JadeColossus ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:JadeColossusRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a jade colossus can spray a blast of green energy in either a 60-foot cone or a 120-foot line. A creature in the affected area takes 15d6 points of damage, Reflex half DC 26. A creature slain as the result of this breath weapon transforms into jade. The save DC is Constitution-based. A creature turned to jade has Hardness 6, hp 40. This effect can be reversed by casting stone to flesh, wish, or miracle. The victim remains dead, but can then be raised or resurrected normally.

AAA	KEY:JadeColossus ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:JadeColossusRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A jade colossus is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A disintegrate spell slows a jade colossus (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds, with no saving throw.  A shatter spell deals 3d12 points of damage to a jade colossus, with no saving throw.  A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the jade colossus and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A jade colossus gets no saving throw against fire effects.

AAA	KEY:JadeColossus ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:JadeColossusRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Light Reflection (Ex) The angles and makeup of the jade colossus allows it to reflect any light-based attacks or effects (it cannot reflect natural sunlight however). Reflected light acts as an emanation (lasting 1 round) that blinds all creatures within 40 feet. A creature can attempt a Reflex save DC 26 to avoid being blinded. If the save fails, the creature is blinded for 2d4 rounds (as the blindness spell); creatures that successfully save are instead dazzled for a like amount of time. Undead and similar creatures to whom sunlight is harmful to take 6d6 points of damage (a successful Reflex save DC 26 halves the damage).



Ruby Star of Law

Sages speak of a jade colossus located in the City of Brass that has the ruby star of law (a gem of inestimable value) embedded in its forehead. The Jade Guardian (as it is known in the City) is a
CR:18 advanced jade colossus with the following additional ability.

AAA	KEY:JadeColossus ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:JadeColossusRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Energy Ray (Su): Once per round as a swift action, the Jade Guardian can fire a ray to a range of 200 feet (requires a successful ranged touch attack to hit). Genies hit by this ray must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 26) or take 6d4 points of Constitution damage. On a successful save, the genie takes onehalf damage. Other creatures are affected as follows: Lawful creatures are slowed (as by the slow spell) for 1d4 rounds (no save). Non-lawful creatures take 6d6 points of force damage (no save) and are stunned for 1d4 rounds (DC 26 Fortitude save negates). Should the ruby star of law ever be claimed as a magic item, treat it as a minor artifact that allows use of the energy ray ability indicated above, save that it requires a standard action to activate.

Hypnotic Lights (Su) The corpse candle possesses the ability to create a dancing, twisting pattern of ever-shifting lights that slowly change colors.  The corpse candle can create these lights within 20 feet of itself, covering an area in a 10foot radius spread (usually underwater). Creatures viewing the pattern within 50 feet must make a successful Will save (DC 18) or become fascinated. If the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by that corpse candle's hypnotic lights for one day. The lights remain for as long as the corpse candle concentrates plus 1 minute. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. A fascinated victim moves toward the lights, taking the most direct route available at its normal movement rate. The creature avoids certain dangers (walking off a cliff, walking through fire, etc.) and skirts around such obstructions if possible, but it will swim towards the light if necessary, paying no heed to the need for air. If no path to the light is available, the fascination is broken. Any living creature within the area of light at the end of its turn takes 1d2 points of Constitution damage. This is a death effect.

Crucify Soul (Su) Five times per day as an attack action a crucifixion spirit can point at a single living target within 60 feet and crucify its soul. This requires the crucifixion spirit to succeed at a ranged touch attack. If successful, the target's soul is ripped from its body, which collapses in a heap on the ground. The target's soul appears as a translucent copy of the victim and is suspended above the spot its body collapsed, crucified in midair to a translucent, "X" shaped structure, the soul held in place by translucent spikes or nails. The victim is not dead and is visible to all those viewing it. A crucified soul cannot be attacked or affected by anything, cannot take any actions (other than trying to escape, see below), and experiences excruciating pain that deals 2 negative levels to it in the round it is crucified, and one negative level each round thereafter. The Fortitude save to remove a negative level has a DC of 22. The save DCs are Charisma-based. A crucifixion spirit does not need to concentrate on this ability for it to continue to affect a target. It can direct attacks against a different opponent. A crucified creature can attempt to escape each round by making a DC 22 Will save. If successful, the creature's soul is freed from its torment and returns to its body in the same round. The target is stunned for one round, but afterwards can act normally. A creature slain with this ability cannot be returned to life except through the casting of a wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell. Even then, there is a 50% chance that such magic fails. If the check fails, the creature cannot be restored to life by mortal magic.

AAA	KEY:CryptThing ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CryptThingRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Claws (Ex) A crypt thing's claws are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

AAA	KEY:CryptThing ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CryptThingRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Teleport Other (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a crypt thing can teleport all creatures within 50 feet of it to a randomly determined location.  An affected creature can attempt a DC 20 Will save to negate the effects. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.  An affected creature is teleported in a random direction (roll 1d4: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; 4, west) and a random distance (1d10 x 100 feet) away from the crypt thing. Roll randomly for each creature that fails its saving throw.  A teleported creature arrives in the closest open space at the determined destination. A teleported creature can arrive in mid-air rather than on a solid surface, if the crypt thing wishes. A creature that arrives in mid-air takes falling damage when it contacts a solid surface (unless it has some means to prevent falling, such as the ability to fly, or a feather fall spell).


-----------------------------------------------

Crypt Guardian
DESC:There exists in some parts of the world (and perhaps only truly in legend; sages aren't sure) a variant of the crypt thing known as a crypt guardian. This variant has all the same abilities and powers as a normal crypt thing, with the following changes. The variant does not possess the teleport other ability. Instead, it possesses an ability known as cloak other.

AAA	KEY:CryptGuardian ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CryptGuardianRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Cloak Other (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a crypt guardian can simultaneously paralyze and turn invisible all creatures within 50 feet. An affected creature can make a DC 20 Will save to negate the effects (only one save is required; if it succeeds, both effects are negated). The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. Affected creatures remain paralyzed and invisible for 2d4 days. A new save is allowed each day until the effects are broken, dispelled, or the duration ends.

Bend Light (Ex) By shifting the make-up of its body as a standard action, a crystalline horror can refract natural light into a bright light that radiates out in a 10-foot spread. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Reflex save or be blinded for 3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Creatures to whom sunlight is harmful or unnatural take 2d6 points of damage from the light. Undead creatures caught within the area take 3d6 points of damage, and undead particularly vulnerable to sunlight, such as vampires, take 3d8 points of damage. Creatures that cannot see or perceive objects through the use of vision are unaffected by the blindness, but still suffer damage if they are vulnerable to sunlight.

Crystalline Claws (Ex) A crystallis's claws are extraordinarily strong and are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.  This is a function of the creature itself and if the claws are somehow detached or removed (say from a dead crystallis) they immediately crumble into fine powder.

Additionally, he can form a Huge 16 HD water elemental (known as a Styx elemental) as a standard action using this ability. A Styx elemental uses the standard 16 HD water elemental statistics with the following additional special attack: An opponent hit by a Styx elemental's slam attack must succeed on a DC 23 Will save or forget everything about its past life (treat this as a feeblemind spell). The save DC is Constitution-based. Even if the save is successful, the opponent acts as if affected by a confusion spell (CL 20th) for one day.

When destroyed on one of the aforementioned planes, it takes but a single day for him to reform and return to that plane. To be permanently destroyed, Charon must be slain on all five Lower Planes within a single day.

Disease (Ex) Daemonic Plague: Slam-injury; save Fort DC 47, onset 1 day; frequency 1/ day; effect 2d6 Con damage; cure 3 consecutive saves.  Each time the victim takes Con damage, it must succeed on a second Fort save or lose 2 points of the Con damage permanently. The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:TheOinodaemonDaemon ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TheOinodaemonDaemonRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Transfixing Gaze (Su) A living creature within 30 feet that meets the Oinodaemon's gaze must succeed on a DC 46 Will save, or be held (as the hold person spell, CL 37th). An affected creature can attempt a new save each round to break the effects if it has 24 HD or more; otherwise, only the Oinodaemon can release it, or a wish or miracle can break the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. If the Oinodaemon is slain or moves more than 30 feet away from a held creature, it is automatically released. The Oinodaemon only has to remain within range to maintain this ability; he does not have to concentrate.

Staff of the Lower Planes: This 12-foot long, black wooden staff can only be wielded by the current Oinodaemon or any daemon he allows to wield it. In anyone else's hands, the staff functions as a normal quarterstaff. Upon the current Oinodaemon's death, the staff can be wielded (and it functions as detailed below) by the new Oinodaemon. The staff has the powers listed below. All powers function as the

spell of the same name (CL 25th or the wielder's caster level, whichever is higher). Save DCs are 20 + spell level.
- Doom, fear (1 charge)
- Dominate monster, geas/quest, mass charm monster, unholy aura (2 charges)
- Once per day, wish (grant another's wish) (2 charges)

The staff has an unlimited number of charges, but no more than 50 charges may be expended in a single day.

The staff's powers automatically overcome any other daemon's spell resistance. Any non-daemon that touches the staff takes 10d8 points of electricity damage per round of contact (no save) and gains two negative levels each round it touches the staff. The Fortitude save to remove a negative level has a DC of 35 and can result in actual level loss on a failed save.

AAA	KEY:DemiLich ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DemiLichRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A demi-lich is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A shatter spell deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6), with no saving throw.  A power word kill spell cast by an ethereal caster deals 50 points of damage to the demi-lich if it fails a Fortitude save (DC 19 + caster's relevant ability score modifier). Note: power word kill does not normally allow a save.) A holy smite spell affects the demi-lich normally.  A dispel evil spell deals 2d6 points of damage, with no saving throw.

AAA	KEY:DemiLich ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DemiLichRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Rejuvenation (Su) Unless holy water is poured over the destroyed remains of a demi-lich, the creature reforms in 1d10 days with a successful level check (1d20 + demi-lich's HD) against DC 16.

AAA	KEY:DemiLich ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DemiLichRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Trap the Soul (Su) A demi-lich can trap the souls of up to eight living creatures per day. To use this power, it selects any target it can see within 300 feet. The target is allowed a DC 22 Fortitude saving throw. If the target makes its saving throw, it gains three negative levels (this does not count as a use of trap the soul). If the target fails its save, the soul of the target is instantly drawn from its body and trapped within one of the gems incorporated into the demi-lich's mouth. The gem gleams for 24 hours, indicating the captive soul within. The soulless body collapses in a mass of corruption and molders in a single round, reduced to dust. If left to its own devices, the demi-lich slowly devours the soul over 24 hours-at the end of that time the sou l is completely absorbed, and the victim is forever gone.  If the demi-lich is overcome before the soul is eaten, crushing the gem releases the soul, after which time it is free to seek the afterlife or be returned to its body by the use of resurrection, true resurrection, clone, or miracle. A potential victim protected by a death ward spell is not immune to trap the soul, but receives a +5 bonus on its Fortitude save and is effective against the level loss on a successful save.  The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:DemiLich ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DemiLichRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:

The target can resist the attack by succeeding on a DC 18 Will save. If the save fails, the target dies as the shock of unlife permeates its soul.

Adhesive (Ex) A tarry demodand exudes a thick tar-like substance that acts as a powerful adhesive, holding fast any creatures or items touching it. A tarry demodand has a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks due to its tarry secretions in addition to that provided by its grab ability.  A weapon that strikes a tarry demodand is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 19 Reflex save. A successful DC 19 Strength check is needed to pry it off. The save DC and check DC are Constitution-based.  Strong alcohol dissolves the adhesive. A pint of wine or a similar liquid weakens it, but the tarry demodand can still grapple normally. A tarry demodand can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 1 minute after the creature dies.

Corruptor Demon

AAA	KEY:CorruptorDemon ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorruptorDemonRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Whisper of Madness (Su) When summoned, a demon of corruption automatically establishes a mental link between itself and the one who summoned it (the host). Distance is not a factor to maintain the link, and it can span across planes and dimensions. The demon need not concentrate to maintain the link. A corruptor demon can have in existence at one time a number of links equal to its current HD. A corruptor demon can break a link it has established any time as a free action.  The link allows the demon to speak (as if by telepathy) to the host and submit subconscious thoughts and messages to him or her. Once per task requested of the corruptor demon (or once per week if no task is requested, including fractions of a week if dismissed early), as long as the link is in existence, the host must succeed on a Will save (DC 11 barizou; DC 12 azizou; DC 13 geruzou) or have his alignment shift one increment toward chaotic evil; first along the good-evil axis and then along the lawful-chaotic axis. The save DC is Charisma-based and increases by +1 each week the link is maintained. A successful save prevents the alignment shift for that week but does not break the link.  When  the  host's  alignment  completely  shifts  to chaotic evil (or if the host is chaotic evil when the link  is  first  established),  he  must  immediately succeed on a Will save (DC 15 barizou; DC 16 azizou; DC 17 geruzou) or go permanently insane (as if affected by an insanity spell, caster level 8th). The save DCs are Charisma-based and include a +4 racial bonus.  A  successful  save  negates  the  insanity for  one  month,  after  which  time  a  new save  (same  DC)  must  be  made  again. This cycle continues until the host fails  a save and goes insane or until the link between  host  and  corruptor  demon  is broken. The  link  is  blocked  by  lead  and magical  protection  (antimagic  field,  mind blank, and nondetection) and can be dispelled through magical means (dispel magic, greater restoration, and the like).  The  alignment  shift  caused  by  these  demons can only be removed after the link is broken. This requires the host to voluntarily (meaning no magical intervention such as charm person or suggestion) subject himself to a greater restoration spell. One such spell is needed for each shift along the law-chaos and good-evil axes. If the host was originally good-aligned, he must voluntarily subject himself to an atonement spell.

Scorpions (Ex) A daraka's body is swarming with thousands of tiny scorpions. Creatures attacking a daraka unarmed or with natural weapons are automatically stung for 1d6 points of damage and suffer the effects of the scorpion's poison (see Poison, above).  Alternately, a daraka can sling scorpions from its body to a range of 20 feet. This is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. A creature hit takes 1d6 points of damage from the stinging scorpions and is subjected to their poison. A grappled creature is likewise subjected to the stinging of a daraka's scorpions just as if it had attacked the daraka unarmed (see above).  A daraka has an unlimited supply of scorpions. As fast as it uses them, its body generates more.

Poison (Ex) Caizel's body courses with a virulent poison that she can intensify or suppress at will. It is not secreted through her skin (therefore her touch is not poisonous); rather it is delivered through the exchange of body fluids with another creature (kissing, consummating an encounter, etc.). If a target is not willing to be kissed, she must start a grapple to do so.  Caizel's Poison: Kiss-contact; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d8 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

This effect stuns the creature for 1d4 rounds while its mind processes the information. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by Caizel's touch of ecstasy for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Caizel can suppress this ability at will.

Bonerazor: Bonerazor is a finely crafted and perfectly balanced +2 dagger. Because of its expert craftsmanship it deals 2d4 points of damage on a successful hit.  Additionally, a creature hit must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or be held (as by a hold person spell, CL 20th). The creature can make a new save each round to escape.  A creature remains held as long as Bonerazor remains embedded in its body or until it makes a successful Fortitude save. So long as Caizel is within 50 feet of it, she can command the dagger to return to her hand as a free action.

Acidic Hide (Ex) Tsathogga's demonic form constantly oozes and drips acid. Creatures attacking Tsathogga unarmed or with natural weapons take 2d8 points of acid damage each time one of their attacks hits. Any weapon striking Tsathogga's acidic body likewise takes acid damage.

Blasphemous Croak (Su) Three times per day, Tsathogga can unleash a piercing croak that affects all non-evil creatures within a 100-foot radius as if by a blasphemy spell (CL 20th). There is no save against the effects.

AAA	KEY:Tsathogga ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TsathoggaRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Seeping Darkness (Su) As a free action, Tsathogga can billow forth a cloud of thick, dark fog from his skin. This fog spreads to fill a 50-foot radius, 50 feet high. The darkness generated by the cloud nullifies nonmagical lights and magical lights of 5th level or lower within the area.  Furthermore, all creatures in the area gain concealment, including those that can normally see in such darkness, tough Tsathogga is able to see normally in it. Light descriptor spells of 5th level or lower (such as daylight, dancing lights, and light) are incapable of brightening the area.  This cloud remains for 10 minutes before dispersing. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the cloud in 4 rounds; a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses the cloud in 1 round. Tsathogga cannot use this ability underwater. Once the cloud disperses, Tsathogga can issue a new one if he desires.

Servants of Tsathogga

Followers of Tsathogga are the tsathar and some few evil and vile humans or
giants. He has few other worshippers, though it is rumored that an evil cult
of sahuagin worships him on the Material Plane. Devout followers of Tsathogga
are called Lords of the Gaping Maw and must sign a pact of evil with
Tsathogga. Lords of the Gaping Maw receive spells from Tsathogga and are
granted access to two of the following domains: Chaos, Destruction, Evil, and
Water.

Feed (Su) When a ghaddar slays a humanoid opponent, it can feed on the corpse, devouring both flesh and life force, as a full-round action. Feeding destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising and resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic.  A ghaddar advances in Hit Dice by consuming corpses in this fashion. For every three suitable corpses a ghaddar devours, it gains 1 Hit Die, and its Strength, Constitution, and natural armor increase by +1. Its attack bonus and saves improve as normal for an outsider of its Hit Dice, and it gains skill points, feats, and ability score improvements normally.  The ghaddar only advances by consuming the corpses of creatures whose Hit Dice or levels are equal to or greater than its own current total.

This deals no damage to the hellstoker, and deals 1d6 points of fire damage to any creature touching or grappling the hellstoker. The fire burns for 10 rounds before extinguishing. This does not damage the hellstoker's oily hide; therefore, it still retains its racial bonus to Escape Artist checks (see oily hide below), and it can be caught on fire again.

AAA	KEY:Lucifer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:LuciferRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:
Rod of Infernus Lucifer's black iron rod functions as a Huge +6 trident that he can wield without penalty. It has the following abilities:

Annihilation Ray: Once per round, and no more than five times per day, the rod
can fire a ray to a range of 60 feet. A creature struck by this ray must
succeed on a DC 40 Fortitude save or be annihilated instantly-not even a trace
of dust is left behind. No form of mortal magic can restore life to a creature
annihilated by this ray. Lucifer or a deity can restore the annihilated
creature to life using magic.

Rod of Rulership: The rod has all of the abilities and powers of a rod of
rulership.

Trap the Soul: Once per round, and no more than three times per day, the rod
can fire a ray of hellish-red energy to a range of 60 feet that functions as a
trap the soul spell (CL 20th). A target can make a DC 40 Will save to resist
the effects. If failed, the victim's soul vanishes into Lucifer's rod. Up to
10 such souls can be held in the rod at one time. A trapped soul may be freed
by grasping the rod and speaking a command word.

Any non-devil that touches the rod takes 10d8 points of electricity damage per
round of contact (no save) and gains two negative levels each round it touches
the rod. The Fortitude save to remove a negative level has a DC of 40 and can
result in actual level loss on a failed save. The negative levels cannot be
overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the rod is wielded.
Any goodaligned creature that touches the rod takes 3d6 points of Constitution
drain each round it touches the rod (DC 40 Fortitude save for half).

Hell's Redoubt: Hell's Redoubt is Lucifer's Large suit of +5 heavy
fortification banded mail that has no armor check penalty, speed penalty, and
no chance for arcane spell failure. It was personally crafted for him the
hands of Cheshimiboth, Armorer of the Nine Hells, just prior to the Great
Uprising. To reward this unique devil's genius for crafting, Lucifer had him
murdered in the first moments of the Uprising to prevent him from ever
revealing any vulnerability in the armor he fashioned or ever again crafting
its equal. In addition to its fortification qualities, three times per day,
Lucifer can cause the fires of Hell to spring forth in a 30-foot radius spread
around him (the spread remains stationary once called forth). These fires last
for 3 rounds and deal 10d6 points of fire damage per round (DC 40 Reflex save
for half) and ignore all fire resistance and fire immunity. Only the wearer of
the armor is immune to their effects. Those slain by these fires are
completely destroyed (including their equipment) and cannot be returned to
life through anything short of divine intervention.  Hell's Redoubt functions
as +1 banded mail and bestows five negative levels for as long as it is worn
if worn by anyone other than Lucifer unless the wearer defeats Asmodeus and
gains the Throne of Hell. At that point it resumes its ordinary function.
Anyone wearing the armor is filled with the overwhelming urge to attempt to do
that very thing no matter the cost. The negative levels disappear if the armor
is removed.


Servants of Lucifer

Followers of Lucifer are far and wide and consist of evil humanoids; usually clerics, necromancers, sorcerers, and wizards. Devout followers of Lucifer are called Dark Cardinals and must sign a pact of evil with Lucifer. Dark Cardinals can receive spells from Lucifer and are granted access to two of the following domains: Evil, Law, Strength, and War.

Fiery Aura (Su) As a free action, Xaphan can cause his entire body to erupt in unholy fire (the same fires he uses to stoke his furnaces).

AAA	KEY:Xaphan ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:XaphanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Fiery Gaze (Su) A creature that meets Xaphan's gaze must succeed on a DC 36 Will save or be affected as follows: 1st-round: The victim's blood begins to boil, dealing 3d6 points of fire damage this round; the victim takes a -2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, ability and skill checks, and saves. A DC 37 Fortitude save halves the fire damage but does not negate the penalties. 2nd-round: The victim's blood reaches searing temperatures and begins to burn away muscle and flesh; the circumstance penalty increases to -4. Smoke rises from the victim's flesh. The victim takes 6d6 points of fire damage this round. A DC 37 Fortitude save halves the fire damage but does not negate the penalties.  3rd-round: The victim's blood erupts into an inferno and explodes from its body dealing 12d6 points of fire damage; the victim is stunned for 3 rounds. A DC 37 Fortitude save halves the fire damage but the victim is still stunned.  A successful Will save renders a creature immune to Xaphan's gaze for one day. The save DC against the gaze is Charisma-based and the Fortitude saves are Constitution based.

AAA	KEY:Draug ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DraugRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Call Storm (Su) Once per day, a draug can summon inclement weather to harass its opponents. The effects are felt immediately (i.e., there is no gradual shift in the weather). Otherwise, this ability is identical to the control weather spell (caster level 6th).

AAA	KEY:Draug ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DraugRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Control Ship (Su) A draug has full control over its vessel (wind notwithstanding) so long as it remains at the wheel or within 20 feet of the helmsman. Should it leave the area, its ship meanders in a random direction until the draug regains control. A draug also imbues its ship with special abilities (see Draug Ships, below).


Draug Ships
When a ship sinks beneath the waves, it and its entire crew may return as ghostly wanderers, especially if the captain and crew had a less than scrupulous profession (as pirates, for example). A sunken ship of this nature may undergo a transformation from the negative energy and evil surrounding it.  When this happens, the ship rises from the deep, piloted by a draug and manned by skeletons, brine zombies, zombies, and lacedons. The ship appears as it did at the time of its demise. The sails are tattered and the decks covered with seaweed. When a draug is at the helm, the "ghost ship" gains the following powers:

AAA	KEY:Draug ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DraugRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Buoyancy (Su) Regardless of the condition of the hull, a draug-piloted ship remains afloat in any weather conditions. It is not affected by wind of any type (though the draug can still use the wind to maneuver and sail the ship) and can even sail against gale-force winds. Strong waves may toss the ship about, but will not capsize it as a result.

AAA	KEY:Draug ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DraugRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Flight (Su) A draug can maneuver his ship to leave the waves and take to the air as long as the draug remains on board. This functions as fly cast by a sorcerer with a caster level equal to the draug's HD.

AAA	KEY:Draug ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DraugRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

Heart-Stopping Fear (Su) By revealing its true form to a living creature, a dream spectre instills heart-stopping fear in its foe. A creature viewing the dream spectre must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or suffer a heart attack and be reduced to 0 hit points. On the next round the creature drops to -1 hit point and is dying. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to the heart-stopping fear attack of that dream spectre for one day. This ability only functions against creatures that are awake. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:Drelb ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DrelbRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:
Illusory Retreat (Sp) A drelb can rapidly diminish its form while it advances forward. To the onlooker, it appears as if the drelb is retreating. Creatures succeeding on a DC 20 Will save see through this illusion; otherwise, the drelb advances into melee range and its opponent is considered flat-footed for the drelb's next attack following the use of this ability. A creature that has seen a drelb use this ability before gains a +2 circumstance bonus on its Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +5 racial bonus.

AAA	KEY:Drelb ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DrelbRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:

The save DC (if any) to resist an imitated psionic power or psi-like ability is 12 + the level of the power. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Further, any psionic power or psi-like ability that directly targets a drelb is reflected back on the attacker with full effect (manifester level and save DC equal to that of the original manifester).

Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or signs of its presence.  A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing dust digger flings the creature back 30 feet, stunning it for 1 round unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save.

Gravity Elemental

OUTPUTNAME:[NAME] Elemental
Elemental (Gravity)
DESC:This creature resembles a miniature black hole hovering several feet off the ground.

AAA	KEY:GravityElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GravityElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Distortion (Su) The manipulation of light waves around a gravity elemental grants it a +2 deflection bonus to its Armor Class.

AAA	KEY:GravityElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GravityElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Engulf (Ex) A gravity elemental that starts its turn grappling a creature or holding and object up to one size smaller than itself can absorb the creature or object into its swirling form as a full-round action. An engulfed creature or object takes damage equal to the elemental's slam attack each round it remains engulfed and can take no action other than trying to break free by rolling its CMB vs. the gravity elementals CMD. The gravity elemental gains the grappled condition as long as it has a creature engulfed, and it can only engulf one creature at a time.  A creature that dies while engulfed by a gravity elemental is smashed into atoms and can only be restored to life by a miracle, wish, or the intervention of a deity. An object that is destroyed while it is engulfed by a gravity elemental is destroyed forever and cannot be restored. There is a 1% non-cumulative chance each round that an engulfed creature or object is sent to a random plane.

AAA	KEY:GravityElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GravityElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Missile Weapons (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to any attack from thrown or hurled weapons, arrows, bolts, stones, and similar weapons with a size equal to or less than its own. Any such ranged attack against a gravity elemental automatically fails and the weapon is pulled into the elemental's body.  Captured missiles orbit the gravity elemental's form as long as it desires, and it can release one such missile each round as an improvised thrown weapon.  The weapon deals its normal damage plus the gravity elemental's Strength modifier, and has a range increment of 20 ft. A gravity elemental has the Throw Anything feat as a bonus feat.

AAA	KEY:GravityElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GravityElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Gravity Field (Su) A gravity elemental's manipulation of gravity function like the reverse gravity and telekinesis spells (CL equal to HD). The maximum weight an Elder gravity elemental can lift with its telekinesis is not restricted to 375 lbs. The effects of the gravity field are centered on the gravity elemental and move with it. Additionally, by increasing the pull of gravity around itself a gravity elemental can make creatures within a certain radius too heavy to move, or crush them to a pulp.  Hold: As a full-round action a gravity elemental can cause all corporeal creatures in its area of effect to become too heavy to move. Creatures in the gravity elemental's gravity field must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the held condition until the gravity elemental releases them or they break free. A flying creature has a -4 penalty applied to the save; failure means it is unable to remain airborne and must land. The check DC is Strength-based. The gravity elemental can maintain this ability each round as a fullround action.  The area of effect and save DC depend on the size of the elemental. If the gravity elemental maintains this ability, on successive rounds a held creature can break free by succeeding on a Strength check with a DC equal to the initial Fortitude save. Any land-bound creature two size categories smaller less than the elemental has its speed automatically reduced by half, even if the Strength check is successful.  This ability only works on creatures with weight and mass; incorporeal and gaseous creatures are immune to this power.  Crush: Once per day per 2HD, as a standard action, a gravity elemental can increase the gravity around itself to crushing proportions. Anything within the gravity elemental's gravity field takes bludgeoning damage. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. The area of effect and save DC depend on the elemental's size. The save DC is Strength-based.

AAA	KEY:NegativeEnergyElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:NegativeEnergyElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Death Throes (Su) A negative energy elemental that is killed explodes in a flash of swirling negative energy that affects all within the area (the radius for its death throes ability is the same as the radius for its negative energy aura). Living creatures within the area take 1d8 points of negative energy damage per two HD of the elemental. Negative energy based creatures and undead gain hit points equal to the amount of damage the death throes would have otherwise dealt. (The rules for temporary hit points and doubling hit points as detailed under the elemental's negative energy apply here.) A successful Reflex DC (save DC same as the elemental's negative energy save DC) reduces the damage by half.

AAA	KEY:NegativeEnergyElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:NegativeEnergyElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Negative Energy (Ex) A negative energy elemental infuses a target hit by its slam attack with negative energy. This deals extra damage to a living target (as listed in the statistics block) but heals undead (and other negative energy based creatures) by the same amount. Undead (and other negative	energy based creatures) can be healed above their normal hit point total, gaining extra hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear 1 minute later. Creatures healed to twice their normal hit points (that is, a creature whose hit points are effectively doubled) must succeed on a Fortitude save or explode in a burst of negative energy. The save DC is Constitution based. See the table below for each negative energy elemental's save DC. Negative energy (such as an inflict spell or negative energy channeling) can heal negative energy elementals.

AAA	KEY:NegativeEnergyElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:NegativeEnergyElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Negative Energy Aura (Su) A negative energy elemental radiates an aura of pure negative energy around it. (See the table for the area each elemental affects.) Within a negative energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use negative energy, such as negative energy channeling or the Command Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels higher. Additionally, spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy are maximized (as if the Maximize Spell metamagic feat had been used on them, but the spells don't require higher-level slots). Spells and spell-like abilities that are already maximized are unaffected by this benefit. This aura does not affect the negative energy channeling ability of the negative energy elemental using it, and its effects do not stack with those of other negative energy elementals.  Within a negative energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use positive energy, such as positive energy channeling or the Turn Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels lower. Spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy, including cure spells, require the caster to succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell). If the check fails, the spell does not function but is still lost as a prepared spell or spell slot.  If the check succeeds, the spell functions normally.


AAA	KEY:NegativeEnergyElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:NegativeEnergyElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Negative Energy Channeling (Su) A Large or larger negative energy elemental can channel negative energy as a cleric whose level equals the elemental's Hit Dice. The Will save DC includes a +2 racial bonus.

Psi-Like Abilities (Ps) A psionic elemental has a number of psi-like abilities. Its manifester level (ML) is equal to its Hit Dice unless noted otherwise. The save DCs are Charismabased for all psionic elementals. Psi-like abilities augmented for the elemental's manifester level are noted with an asterisk.

AAA	KEY:PsionicElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PsionicElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:
Warp Reality (Sp) By folding the dimensions around its body, a psionic elemental can automatically deflect one attack per round directed against it back upon the attacker. The attacker takes full damage just as if he had hit the psionic elemental (including any special effects of the attack such as a flaming weapon dealing fire damage). Spells can be reflected using this power, but only those that specifically target the elemental. Area of effect spells are not reflected and have full effect on the psionic elemental.

OUTPUTNAME:[NAME] Elemental 
Elemental (Time)
DESC:This creature appears as a formless cloud of yellowish-red vapor or dust about 5 feet in diameter.

Languages telepathy 100 ft.

Environment Plane of Time
Organization solitary, troupe (noble plus 1-2 common time elementals), or court (royal plus 1-2 nobles and 1-4 common time elementals)
Treasure none

AAA	KEY:TimeElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Alter Age (Su) Once per day, a noble time elemental can age a creature simply by touching it (this requires a melee touch attack). If successful, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or advance forward one aging step (from adulthood to middle age, from middle age to old, from old to venerable, and so on). If a character ages, he takes all the effects to his physical ability scores, but does not gain any of the bonuses to his mental ability scores. A venerable creature affected by this ability dies (from massive cell death) and cannot be restored to life by mortal magic. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Alternately, a time elemental can use its alter age ability to reduce a character's age. If the target is unwilling, the time elemental must succeed on a melee touch attack.  An unwilling target can make a Fortitude save to avoid the effects. If the save fails, the target ages one age step backwards (from middle age to adulthood for example) and gains all bonuses to physical ability scores from his new age (simply flip the penalties listed on the aging table into an equal numbered bonus). A character that regresses in age does not reduce its mental ability scores. This ability does not affect a character that has died from old age.  A time elemental can also use this ability to age vegetable matter 10-200 years (older or younger) or mineral matter 100-2,000 years (older or younger).  Royal time elementals can use this ability twice per day.

AAA	KEY:TimeElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Cell Death (Ex) Damage dealt by a time elemental's slam attack does not heal naturally (but it can still be healed magically). Additionally, a creature slain by a time elemental can only be raised through the successful casting of a miracle, true resurrection, or wish spell.

AAA	KEY:TimeElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Foresight (Su) A time elemental can see a few seconds into the future. This ability prevents it from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or flanked. It also grants the time elemental an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom bonus. This ability can be negated, but the time elemental can restart it as a free action on its next turn.  Immunity to Temporal Magic (Ex) Time elementals are immune to all time-related spells and effects (including time stop, temporal stasis, and the like). Note, the time stop ability of the noble and royal time elementals can affect those time elementals of lesser power (i.e., a noble can affect a common and a royal can affect a noble or common).

AAA	KEY:TimeElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Multi-Manifestation (Su) A time elemental exists in several other dimensions at any given time. As a standard action, it can bring forth 1d4 of these manifestations to its current locale in order to gain multiple attacks that round. Treat each manifestation as a separate time elemental with hit points equal to the time elemental's current hit points. A manifestation cannot use any of the supernatural or spelllike abilities of the time elemental (a manifestation does however gain the time elemental's foresight ability). A time elemental cannot have more than four manifestations present at one time.  Because each manifestation is a part of the time elemental that called them, a successful attack on the time elemental or any of its manifestations deals an equal amount of damage to them all.

AAA	KEY:TimeElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:
Summon Time Elementals (Sp) Once per day, a royal time elemental can attempt to summon 1d4 common time elementals with a 70% chance of success or 1-2 noble time elementals with a 30% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell.

AAA	KEY:TimeElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Temporal Displacement (Su) By making a melee touch attack against a foe, a noble or royal time elemental can remove that creature from the current time stream if it fails a Fortitude save. The save is Constitution-based.  On a failed save, the creature disappears in a flash of white energy. For a number of minutes equal to the time elemental's Hit Dice, the displaced creature is effectively nonexistent. No form of magic, effect, or force can detect or aid such a creature. A displaced creature can attempt a Wisdom check (DC equal to the initial Fort DC) on its turn to break the effects and end the displacement. The save is Constitution-based.  When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the same space it was in before being displaced. If the space is occupied when the creature returns, it is shunted aside to the first open space and takes no damage. A noble or royal time elemental can use this ability three times per day.  Time Jaunt (Su) A time elemental can slip through the time stream and appear anywhere on the same plane of existence as if by greater teleport. This ability transports the time elemental and up to four other creatures within a 30-foot radius. Unwilling creatures can attempt a Will save to avoid being carried away. This ability is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name (caster level equal to the elemental's HD). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Time Stop (Sp) Noble and royal time elementals can create an effect identical to a time stop spell once per day (caster level equals the time elemental's HD).

ELEMENTAL CONSTRUCTS
DESC:Elemental constructs are golems or automatons forged of one of the four basic elements-air, earth, fire, or water-bound to serve their creator. The creation of an elemental construct requires no less than five elemental spirits(of the same type) which are unwillingly bound into the form of the elemental construct.  Elemental constructs are used by powerful mages as servants, bodyguards, and assassins. An elemental construct, like any other automaton follows any order or command given to it to the best of its ability.

An elemental construct's creator can command it if the construct is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If not commanded, an elemental construct usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the elemental construct a simple command to govern its actions in his or her absence. The elemental construct's creator can order the construct to obey the commands of another person (who might in turn place the elemental construct under someone else's control, and so on), but the elemental construct's creator can always resume control over his creation by commanding the elemental construct to obey him alone.

Each elemental construct appears as a humanoid creature about 9 feet tall and is composed entirely of its native element.

Construction
An elemental construct's body is formed completely of one of the four elements air, earth, fire, or water. The materials must be the finest quality or purest form taken from the respective plane and mixed with rare oils, powders, and other ingredients totaling 5,000 gp.

ELEMENTAL CONSTRUCT

Immunity to Magic (Ex) An air elemental construct is immune to any spell or spelllike ability that allows spell resistance.  In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A control weather spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to an air elemental construct.  The construct can attempt a Fortitude save (DC 17 + caster's relevant ability score modifier) for half damage.  An iron body or ice storm spell slows (as the slow spell) an air elemental construct for 2d6 rounds. Note the iron body spell does not change the construct's form, nor does an ice storm spell actually damage the construct.  A control winds spell heals an air elemental construct of all of its lost hit points.

It can also occupy spaces occupied by its enemies. (This ability is similar to a gaseous form spell-note the air elemental construct is not subject to wind effects like the gaseous form spell.) Any piercing or slashing attack against an air elemental construct has a 20% miss chance. Bludgeoning attacks deal damage normally.

In addition, the pounded creature is stunned for 1 round; a DC 39 Fortitude save negates this additional effect. The save DC is Strength-based.

Fiery Aura (Ex) Anyone within 10 feet of a fire elemental construct must succeed on a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 2d8 points of fire damage each round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:FireElementalConstruct ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FireElementalConstructRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A fire elemental construct is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance.  In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A cold effect slows a fire elemental construct (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds with no saving throw. This is in addition to any damage it takes because of its vulnerability to cold.  A quench spell negates the fire elemental construct's damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 round. Any water-based spell of 5th level or higher deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the fire elemental construct. The construct can attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + spell level + caster's relevant ability score modifier) to half the damage.  Any fire-based spell or effect heals 1 point of damage on the fire elemental construct for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the construct to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.

Encephalon gorgers (sometimes known as cranial vampires) are malevolent creatures from another dimension or plane of existence. They are greatly feared by intelligent creatures for they use such beings (their brain fluid to be exact) to power their great cities. Many of these creatures have constructed strongholds or outposts on the Material Plane, though it is unknown when they first appeared.
Encephalon gorgers dislike for direct sunlight, though they are not harmed


by it. When traveling aboveground in daylight hours, they usually cloak

AAA	KEY:EncephalonGorger ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EncephalonGorgerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Adrenal Surge (Ex) Twice per day, an encephalon gorger can create an effect on itself equivalent to a haste spell (caster level 10th).

AAA	KEY:EncephalonGorger ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EncephalonGorgerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Mindfeed (Su): If an encephalon gorger begins its turn grappling an opponent, it can attempt to suck its brain fluid with a successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it drains cerebral fluid, dealing 1d4 points of Intelligence drain each round the pin is maintained. On each successful mindfeed attack, the encephalon gorger gains 5 temporary hit points. This ability does not work against nonliving creatures or creatures without a central brain mass. The encephalon gorger must be able to reach the head or neck of the target creature to use this ability.

AAA	KEY:EncephalonGorger ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EncephalonGorgerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Mindsense (Su) As a move action, an encephalon gorger can gauge the relative intelligence level of any creature within 60 feet as follows: unintelligent, animal (Int 1-2), low (3-8), average (8-12), high (13-16), genius (17-20), or supra-genius (21+).

Mind Screen (Ex): The mind of an encephalon gorger is an alien and dangerous place. Should a creature attempt to scan the mind or read the thoughts of an encephalon gorger (with detect thoughts, telepathy, or the like), it must make a successful (DC 20) Will save or be driven permanently insane (as by an insanity spell, caster level 15th); if the save succeeds, the creature is instead confused (as the spell) for 1d4 rounds.

Engulf (Ex) Though it is a Tiny monster, the hood can drop onto the head of a Medium or smaller creature as a standard action. If the hood's attack succeeds, it can immediately make a grapple check to grab its target and constrict. The hood's crawling tendrils wrap themselves tightly around its victim, seeking entry into the creature's ears, nose, and throat, making it difficult to remove. Any attacks against the hood deal half damage to the hood and its grappled target inside.

AAA	KEY:ExecutionersHood ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ExecutionersHoodRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Strangle (Ex) A grappling executioner's hood entirely covers its opponent's head with an airtight grip. A creature that is grappled by the hood cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components and must hold its breath (see Suffocation, Pathfinder Core Rulebook) unless it doesn't speak or breathe through its head.

AAA	KEY:ExecutionersHood ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ExecutionersHoodRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Vulnerability to Alcohol (Ex) Strong alcohol harms the hood. Every quart poured on it causes 1 point of damage. Four quarts of alcohol incapacitates it and forces it to release a grappled target.

AAA	KEY:EyeKiller ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EyeKillerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Death Gaze (Su): By using natural or magical light that illuminates it (meaning the eye killer must be within the radius covered by a natural or magical light source), an eye killer can amplify the light and refocus it in a line that functions as a death ray to a range of 50 feet. The eye killer must make a ranged touch attack against its target as a standard action. If successful, the creature struck must make succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or perish. Even if the save succeeds, the victim takes 3d6 points of damage. An eye killer can use this gaze once per day. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Eye killers are immune to their own gaze attack and to the gaze attack of other eye killers. If the eye killer's gaze attack is reflected back upon it, it amplifies the intensity and projects it at a new target as an immediate action. The save DC to resist this gaze is increased by +2.

AAA	KEY:EyeKiller ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EyeKillerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Sunlight Vulnerability (Ex) If natural sunlight (including a daylight spell) is brought within 5 feet of an eye killer, it immediately releases a grappled foe and attempts to move as far away from the source of light as possible. On subsequent rounds, an eye killer is dazzled as long as it remains within 5 feet of the light source.

AAA	KEY:EyeoftheDeep ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EyeoftheDeepRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Eye Rays (Su) Each of the creature's eyes stalks can produce a magical ray once per round as a free action.  The creature can aim both of its eye rays in any direction. Each of its eye rays resembles a spell cast by a 12th-level caster and follows the rules for a ray (see Aiming a Spell in the Core Rulebook). Each eye ray has a range of 150 feet and a save DC of 17. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Hold Person Left eye-A target struck by this ray must succeed on a Will save or be affected as though by the spell. An eye of the deep will use this ray early in a fight so as to disable its opponents. Hold Monster Right eye-A target struck by this ray must succeed on a Will save or be affected as though by the spell. This is used in the same manner as the hold person ray. Minor Image By combining the rays of both eyes, the eye of the deep can replicate the minor image spell. It does not have to succeed on an attack roll to use this ray. The illusion is generated at any point within range and in the eye of the deep's line of sight.

AAA	KEY:EyeoftheDeep ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EyeoftheDeepRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Stun Cone (Su) An eye of the deep's central eye can, once per round, produce a cone extending straight ahead from its front to a range of 30 feet. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be stunned for 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Feats An eye of the deep's Flyby Attack feat allows it to take a move action and another standard action at any point during the move while swimming. It cannot take a second move action during a round in which it makes a flyby attack.

FALSE SPIDERS
False spiders are spiderlike creatures that are very aggressive and highly
predatory in nature, often hunting at night when the element of surprise is
theirs to be had. False spiders dwell in shallow burrows which the dig with
their massive pincers. There are two kinds of false spiders: pedipalps and
solifugids.

False spiders are highly territorial and are likely to attack any living
creature that enters their area.

Poison Cloud (Ex) When threatened, a poisonous pedipalp releases a cloud of noxious fumes in a 20-foot radius around its body. Living creatures within the cloud must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d6 rounds. The poisonous pedipalp can use this cloud three times per day. The save DC is Constitution-based. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the nauseated creature.

Note that the fen witch does not need to speak a language the creature understands in order to affect it; she only needs to speak its true name. Other fen witches or creatures who hear the target's true name cannot use this ability; it only functions for the fen witch after she has used her mind probe ability on the target. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Whether the fen witch's Death Speak ability is successful or not, the target's name remains fresh in her mind for 24 hours.

The target can resist the mental trespassing by succeeding on a DC 15 Will save. If the save fails, the fen witch has learned the creature's true name and can use her death speak ability. Creatures with an Intelligence score of 2 or less and creatures with no Intelligence score are immune to this ability. Psionic creatures can use defense modes or other psionic abilities to counter this probe. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same fen witch's mind probe for one day.

AAA	KEY:FirePhantom ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FirePhantomRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Fire (Ex) A fire phantom's fists are swathed in elemental fire. Any melee hit deals fire damage. Creatures attacking a fire phantom unarmed or with natural weapons take fire damage each time their attacks hit.

AAA	KEY:FirePhantom ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FirePhantomRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Fire Blast (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, as a standard action, a fire phantom can hurl a small globe of elemental fire to a range of 30 feet (no range increment). By making a successful ranged touch attack, it deals 2d6 points of fire damage. A creature hit must make a successful DC 15 Reflex save to avoid catching on fire.  The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:FirePhantom ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FirePhantomRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Immolation (Su) Normally used as a last resort, a fire phantom can detonate itself in an inferno of elemental fire that deals 6d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 10-foot radius. A successful DC 15 Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Charisma-based. This instantly kills the fire phantom if it fails a DC 20 Will save.  Even if the fire phantom survives, its flames are extinguished for 1 minute. During this time the fire phantom cannot use its fire blast ability and cannot deal fire damage with its slam attack. It retains the fire subtype. After 1 minute, its fires relight and it may deal fire damage normally and use its fire blast ability. If the fire phantom survives the immolation it may not use it again for one day.

AAA	KEY:FirePhantom ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FirePhantomRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Rage (Ex) A fire phantom is in a constant state of agony from the elemental fire that consumes its body. Therefore, it is always in a berserk rage and gains Str +4 and -2 AC (both already included in the statistics block above). The fire phantom cannot end this rage voluntarily and it cannot be suppressed or negated.

Scalding Blast (Su) As a full round action, a fire whale can release a blast of superheated air from its blowhole that scalds or burns those contacting it. The cone-shaped blast has a range of 60 ft and deals 12d6 points of damage. A successful DC 22 Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Once a fire whale uses this ability, it must wait 1d4 rounds before using its scalding blast again. After using this ability four times, the fire whale must submerge for at least two full rounds before it can use it again.

AAA	KEY:FlailSnail ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FlailSnailRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Mucus (Ex) As a free action, a flail snail can excrete a trail of mucus which covers its space and lasts for 10 minutes.  This mucus comes in two types: slimy and sticky. Slimy mucus covers three squares with the effects of a grease spell.  Sticky mucus covers the squares with the effects of a web spell. Both effects are DC 14. The saves are Constitutionbased.  Flail snails are immune to this mucus. Both types of mucus can be burned way as per the web spell.

AAA	KEY:FlailSnail ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FlailSnailRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Retraction (Ex) A flail snail can pull its fleshy parts back into its shell as a swift action, increasing its natural armor bonus by +6, but it cannot move or attack while retracted. It can return to normal as a free action.

AAA	KEY:FlailSnail ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FlailSnailRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Slime Rope (Ex) A flail snail can turn its mucus into a ropelike strand up to 60 ft. long, and can use this rope to hang itself and up to 1,000 extra pounds from the ceiling indefinitely, or to lower itself safely at a speed of 20 feet per round. It can climb back up this rope at a speed of 10 feet per round. Once the snail breaks contact with the rope, the slime decomposes in 1d4 rounds, after which it cannot be used by the snail or any other creatures. While the slime rope exists, other creatures can climb the rope with a DC 20 Climb check.

AAA	KEY:FlailSnail ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FlailSnailRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Suction (Ex) A snail's foot adheres to surfaces so well that its 10-foot climb speed applies even on perfectly sheer surfaces and ceilings, with no chance to fall off unless the foot is actively pinned and peeled away as part of a grapple.

AAA	KEY:FlailSnail ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FlailSnailRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Warp Magic (Su) Anytime a spell targets a flail snail, there is an 80% chance that it produces a random effect instead of affecting the snail. Only spells that directly target the flail snail are warped; area effect spells are not affected. If a spell is warped, roll 1d10 and consult the following table.

1d10 | Result
1-3 | Spell misfires. For the next 1d4 rounds, the caster must make a DC 15 concentration check to successfully cast spells.
4-6 | Spell misfires. The creature nearest the flail snail is affected as if the spell had been cast on him.
7-9 | Spell fails; nothing happens
10 | Spell rebounds on caster (as spell turning)

-----------------------------------------------

Greater Flail Snail
A flail snail has one mace-like tentacle per Hit Die. Thus, a 6 HD flail snail has 6 tentacles; an 8 HD flail snail has 8 tentacles; and a 12 HD flail snail has 12 tentacles.

Attach (Ex) If a giant flea hits with a touch attack, it uses its many legs to attach itself to the opponent's body. While attached the giant flea loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 13. It gains a +12 racial bonus to CMD checks while attached. An attached flea can be struck with a weapon or removed by an opposed CMB attack to pluck it free. On a critical failure (a roll of 1) the flea's head snaps off in the victim and continues to drain blood for 1d8 more rounds.  The head can be removed with a successful DC 18 Heal check.

AAA	KEY:Flumph ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FlumphRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Acid Injection (Ex) When a flumph strikes an opponent with its spikes, it injects a burning, irritating acid that deals 1d4 points of damage immediately and another 1d4 points on the round after the attack. The target can end the acid's effects by submerging the wound in water for a round or by being treated with a DC 15 Heal check. A creature grappling or swallowing the flumph takes this acid damage automatically every round it maintains this contact.

AAA	KEY:Flumph ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FlumphRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Stench Spray (Ex) A flumph can spray a 20-foot line of foulsmelling liquid once every 1d4 rounds. This spray functions like the stench universal monster ability, except it only affects creatures struck by the spray, which must make a DC 11 Fortitude save or be sickened for 5 rounds.  The save DC is Constitution-based. Alternatively, the flumph can concentrate the spray on a single target within 5 feet - if the target fails its saving throw, it is nauseated for 5 rounds; otherwise, it is sickened for 1 minute. The odor from this spray lingers in the area and on all creatures struck for 1d4 hours, and can be detected at a range of 100 feet (creatures with the scent ability can smell it at double this range).

The animated creatures resemble zombies (and use their stats) and are under the control of the fogwarden that animated them. They are not undead however, and cannot be turned or rebuked. If the fogwarden is slain or moves more than 20 feet from a zombie, the animated creature collapses dead and cannot be animated again.

AAA	KEY:AAA ~ Fogwarden	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FogwardenRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Electricity Discharge (Su) Electricity constantly plays across a fogwarden's form. Any metal object (including metal weapons) that contacts a fogwarden's body takes 3d6 points of electricity damage. Magic items receive a DC 13 Reflex saving throw to reduce the damage by half.  Nonmagical items and objects receive no save and automatically take full damage. A creature holding the object or weapon at the time of contact takes 3d6 points of electricity damage as well (DC 13 Reflex save for half).

AAA	KEY:ForestersBane ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ForestersBaneRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Snap and Saw (Ex) A forester's bane can saw at an opponent, dealing slashing damage, when it makes a successful grapple check. This attack deals 1d4+3 points of slashing damage per stalk. It cannot attack a pinned opponent with any stalk that has already attacked another opponent that round. A forester's bane can only attempt to grapple opponents 1 or more sizes smaller than itself. Because of its four leaves, it can grapple up to four different opponents at one time with a single grapple check. It can also attack a single opponent with more than one leaf, gaining a +2 bonus on its grapple check with each extra leaf (+13 grapple with two leaves, +15 grapple with three leaves, and +17 grapple with all four leaves).  Both leaves and stalks each have 10 hit points and can be attacked by making a successful sunder attempt. Attacking a forester's bane's leaf or stalk does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the leaf is currently grappling a target, the forester's bane takes a -4 penalty on its opposed roll to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a leaf or stalk deals no damage to a forester's bane. Attacks that hit a leaf deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.  Destroyed leaves and stalks grow back in 2d4 weeks if the forester's bane is not killed.

Create Gallows Tree Zombie (Su) When a creature dies within 15 feet of a gallows tree, it uses a sharpened tendril to slice open the creature's abdomen, thereby spilling the corpse's innards on the ground. The organs and fluids are then absorbed by the tree's roots.  Corpses of a size other than Medium or Large are simply left to rot. Medium or Large corpses are filled with a greenish pollen fired from one of the tree's branches. The abdominal wound heals over the next 1d4 days, at which time the slain creature rises as a gallows tree zombie connected by a tether-vine to the gallows tree that created it. Gallows tree zombies possess none of their former abilities.

Limited Gaseous Form (Ex) Because it has solid body parts that constantly float and swirl within it, a cinder ghoul has a limited version of the gaseous form ability. Although other gaseous creatures can issue under the crack of a door, a cinder ghoul cannot. A cinder ghoul can, however, make slam attacks, retains its natural armor bonus, and all supernatural attacks. Spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities affect them normally. A cinder ghoul cannot enter water or other liquid. It is not ethereal or incorporeal, and is affected by winds or other forms of moving air to the extent that the wind pushes them in the direction the wind is moving.  However, even the strongest wind can't disperse or damage a cinder ghoul. Because it contains burning embers and small bits of perpetually smoldering flesh, a cinder ghoul cannot hide and gets no bonuses to Stealth checks in an area of mist, smoke, or other gas.

Smoke inside the victim's lungs burns the surrounding tissues and organs, dealing 1d2 points of Constitution damage each round. The affected creature can attempt another Fortitude save each round to cough out the burning residue. The save DC is Charisma-based.

The dust ghoul can control and direct these creatures as long as it is "alive" and within 100 feet.  The dust creatures have a speed of 10 feet and each has only one attack; a grapple. Each has a CMB equal to 1/2 dust ghoul's HD + its Strength modifier (+12 CMB for the standard dust ghoul).  A dust creature holds but does not harm creatures it grapples. The dust humanoids are immune to all attacks and spells, except water-based spells and effects. A gallon of water instantly destroys a dust humanoid. If the dust ghoul moves more than 100 feet away from a dust creature, that dust creature collapses into a pile of harmless dust.

Fist of Sand (Su) Once per day as a move action, a sand giant can form a volume of sand within 40 feet into the shape of a 20-foot long arm that ends in a clenched fist. The arm is Huge and has a space of 15 ft. and a reach of 20 ft. The arm and fist cannot move from the location where it was created.  The sand giant can order the arm to attack a target as a move action. Once given a target, the arm automatically attacks that target on the giant's turn. The arm remains for a number of rounds equal to the sand giant's Hit Dice (19 rounds for a typical sand giant). A sand giant does not need to concentrate to maintain the arm and can direct it to attack a new target or adapt a new tactic as a free action.  The arm's base attack bonus is equal to that of the giant that created it, and it deals slam damage equal to the slam attack for a creature of its size (Huge). Any creature struck must succeed on a DC 29 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based, using the HD of the sand giant and the Strength of the fist of sand.  The arm has an AC of 20 (+12 natural, -2 size) and has hit points equal to three times the Constitution score of the sand giant that created it. It has a Strength score of 30.  The arm loses shape if it is reduced to 0 or less hit points, the duration expires, or the sand giant dies.

Luck/Unluck (Su) When a golden cat selects an "owner" it grants that creature good fortune. Three times per day, so long as the golden cat is within 40 feet, the owner can reroll one die roll and take the most favorable result. Only one die can be rerolled each round. This ability is a power of the cat, not the owner, though the owner can simply telepathically communicate its desire to the cat. A golden cat cannot be forced to activate this ability if it does not wish to do so (unless magically compelled). Each time the golden cat activates this ability and the owner rerolls a die, all other creatures (including the owner's allies) within 40 feet of the golden cat must reroll one die roll and take the least favorable result each time.

AAA	KEY:BloodGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BloodGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Blood Consumption (Su) Each time a blood golem hits a living opponent with a slam attack, it gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt. These bonus hit points are added to the blood golem's total even if the addition takes it above its current maximum hit points. A blood golem cannot gain more hit points than the maximum hit points allowed by its HD (not including any bonus hit points it may have from its Con score). For example, a 7-HD blood golem cannot gain more than 56 hit points.  If a blood golem successfully hits an opponent with both of its slam attacks in a single round, that opponent suffers catastrophic blood expulsion, taking 2d4 points of Constitution damage (DC 15 Fortitude save for half). A blood golem gains 5 hit points per point of Constitution damage it deals. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.  When a blood golem reaches its maximum hit points for its Hit Dice, it divides (see cell division, below).

AAA	KEY:BloodGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BloodGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Cell Division (Ex) When a blood golem absorbs enough blood to raise its hit points to the maximum for its HD, it splits into two identical blood golems, each with half the original's hit points. For example, a 7-HD blood golem that reaches 56 hit points splits into two 7-HD blood golems with 28 hit points each.

AAA	KEY:BloodGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BloodGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Vulnerability to Magic (Ex) A blood golem is slowed (as the spell) for 1d4 rounds by any cold-based attacks or effects. A purify food and water spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to a blood golem. A blood golem can attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + caster's ability score modifier) to reduce the damage by half.

AAA	KEY:FlagstoneGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FlagstoneGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Camouflage (Ex) While flattened, a flagstone golem is nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding floor. It takes a DC 25 Perception check to notice a flattened flagstone golem for what it is. Dwarves get a +2 bonus on Perception checks to notice a flattened flagstone golem.

AAA	KEY:FlagstoneGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FlagstoneGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Energy Absorption (Su) Any energy-based (acid, fire, cold, electricity, sonic) attack that directly targets a flagstone golem is absorbed into its body dealing no damage to the golem. A flagstone golem can use the absorbed energy to repair itself, healing 1 hit point for every 3 points of damage the attack would have otherwise dealt. Or it can release the energy in a 30-foot cone that deals 3d8 points of energy damage (of whatever type was absorbed) to all within the area. An affected opponent can attempt a DC 14 Reflex save to reduce the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based. The flagstone golem can store the energy before releasing it as an energy blast for a number of rounds equal to half its Hit Dice (four rounds for the standard flagstone golem).

AAA	KEY:FlagstoneGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FlagstoneGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Flatten (Ex) As a standard action, once per round, a flagstone golem can flatten its form to become (or appear to become) a section of floor, road, or any other stone surface. While flattened it cannot move or attack and its damage reduction increases to 20/adamantine. A flagstone golem can reform into its humanoid shape as a standard action.

AAA	KEY:FlagstoneGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FlagstoneGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A flagstone golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance.  In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A transmute rock to mud spell slows it (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw.  A transmute mud to rock spell heals all its lost hit points.  A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the golem's structure, but it negates the flagstone golem's damage reduction for 1 round.

AAA	KEY:FlagstoneGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FlagstoneGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

AAA	KEY:FurnaceGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FurnaceGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Furnace-Interior (Ex) A furnace golem can try to shove a grabbed opponent up to two sizes smaller than itself into its interior by making a successful grapple check.  An opponent thrown into the furnace golem's interior is trapped as a metal grating closes over the opening in the same round. A trapped creature automatically takes 2d6 points of fire damage each round. Escaping the creature's interior requires a successful Strength check (DC 30) to bend the bars. Alternately a trapped creature can escape by dealing at least 25 points of damage to the bars (AC 22). Note, the golem's damage reduction applies to all attacks against the bars.  A Huge furnace golem's interior can hold 2 Medium, 8 Small, or 16 Tiny or smaller creatures.

AAA	KEY:FurnaceGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FurnaceGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Heat (Ex) A furnace golem's entire form is extremely hot. Any slam attack deals fire damage. Creatures attacking a furnace golem unarmed or with natural weapons take this same fire damage each time one of their attacks hits.

AAA	KEY:FurnaceGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FurnaceGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A furnace golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance.  In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature as noted below.  A magical attack that bypasses its cold resistance slows a furnace golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw.  A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the furnace golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of damage would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.

Engulf (Ex) A gelatinous golem can try to wrap an opponent up to one size smaller than itself in its body as a standard action. The gelatinous golem attempts a grapple that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple the gelatinous golem establishes a hold. Attacks that hit an engulfing gelatinous golem deal half their damage to the golem and half to the engulfed victim.  An engulfed opponent is subjected to the gelatinous golem's paralysis and acid each round it remains trapped. A trapped opponent can do nothing other than attempt to escape. Further, an engulfed foe must hold its breath or begin drowning (see the Core Rulebook for the drowning rules).  While engulfing an opponent, a gelatinous golem is not considered grappled and can move and attack normally.

Animated Host (Su) Once a victim trapped within an iron maiden has died, it reanimates as a zombie in the next round (as if by an animate dead spell). It cannot escape, however, and serves only to fuel the iron maiden and provide it with skills and abilities. While it is trapped, the zombie cannot be attacked, damaged, turned, rebuked, or commanded, and it doesn't suffer any damage from the bladed lid. If the lid of the golem is somehow forced open, the zombie has the normal abilities of a Medium zombie (as detailed in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary). The victim of an iron maiden golem must be alive when it is placed inside and the lid is closed or the golem's animate host ability fails.

Bladed Lid (Ex) A living creature inside an iron maiden when the lid is closed is pierced by twenty dagger-like blades, dealing a total of 50 points of piercing damage each round. The lid automatically seals with an arcane lock spell with a caster level equal to that of the iron maiden golem's creator (14th level usually). The lid can be forced open with a successful Strength check (DC 34) or by casting dispel magic. The knock spell has no effect on the lid. The check DC is Strength-based and includes a +10 bonus from the arcane lock spell.  Because of the shape of the iron maiden, only a Medium humanoid can be sealed inside.

In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows an iron maiden golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw.  A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the iron maiden golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.

AAA	KEY:IronMaidenGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:IronMaidenGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Steal Essence (Su) An iron maiden golem that has created a host using its animate host ability (see above) gains 10 temporary hit points, uses its own base attack bonus or the host's (whichever is higher), and can make normal use of the victim's skills, feats, and non-magical class abilities.  The golem must substitute its own ability scores when determining its total skill bonuses; therefore it cannot use skills requiring Constitution or Intelligence, and since it cannot speak, many Charisma skills are severely limited. Likewise, the iron maiden golem must meet the requirements for any feat in order to make use of that feat (thus feats such as Dodge and Combat Expertise are unavailable to the golem). An iron maiden cannot use any divine spells or divinely granted special abilities, since the host within is no longer able to receive such abilities from her deity. An iron maiden likewise cannot use any arcane spells as its inherent magic immunity disrupts any attempt to do so.

Anodized (Improved) Magnesium Golem
The golem is anodized during the creation process by submerging it in a solution of acid. During this time, the creator must cast lightning or some other electricity-based effect into the solution. This deals no damage to the golem. After four hours, the magnesium golem is removed from the solution.  An anodized magnesium golem is identical to a normal magnesium golem detailed above but it does not have the rust vulnerability trait of the normal magnesium golem.

AAA	KEY:WitchDollGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitchDollGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Linked Attack (Su) When a witch-doll golem successfully establishes a witchdoll link, any damage taken by the witch-doll golem from any source other than the linked host deals half its damage to the golem and half its damage to the linked target so long as they are within 60 feet of each other. Only the linked target can successfully attack a witchdoll golem and not take "linked damage". Attacks that don't damage a witch-doll golem (because of its immunities or its damage reduction) likewise deal no damage to the linked target. Attacks that damage the linked target do not damage the witchdoll golem (the link it establishes is one way). Healing (or repair in the case of the witch-doll golem) is not passed through the link.  A witch-doll golem cannot be programmed to attack itself in order to damage its programmed target.

Witch-Doll Link (Su) A witch-doll golem can establish an invisible link between itself and its programmed target by making a successful melee attack against its programmed target. If successful, the opponent can attempt a DC 19 Fortitude save to resist the link. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. A witch-doll link is broken if the witch-doll golem is destroyed, the target dies, or the witch-doll golem is programmed with a new target. A witch-doll golem cannot establish this link with any other creature other than its programmed target.

Immunity to Magic (Ex) A witch-doll golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance.  In addition, certain spells function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A confusion spell slows it (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw.  A mending spell heals 2d6 hit points.

AAA	KEY:WitchDollGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitchDollGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Resist Magic (Ex) A witch-doll golem gains a +4 bonus on all saving throws against any spell or spell-like ability or effect cast by its programmed target (provided the effect gets past its immunity to magic). The witch-doll does not have to be linked to its target to gain this bonus.

Breath Weapon (Su) A gorgimera has two breath weapons, each of which can be used independently of the other (thus it can breathe twice in a given round as a single standard action).

Dragon A gorgimera's dragon head breath weapon depends on the color of its dragon head, as summarized on the table below. Regardless of its type, a gorgimera's breath weapon is usable once every 1d4 rounds, deals 3d8 points of damage, and allows a DC 21 Reflex save for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.  To determine a gorgimera's head color and breath weapon randomly, roll 1d10 and consult the table below.

1d10 | Head Color | Breath Weapon |
1-2  | Black      | 40-foot line of acid |
3-4  | Blue       | 40-foot line of lightning |
5-6  | Green      | 20-foot cone of gas (acid) |
7-8  | Red        | 20-foot cone of fire |
9-10 | White      | 20-foot cone of cold |

Gorgon A gorgimera's gorgon head breath weapon is usable once every 1d4 rounds (no more than twice per day), turns a creature to stone permanently, and allows a DC 19 Fortitude save to avoid. The save DC is Constitution-based. The breath weapon is a 30-foot cone.

Graymalkin 

GRAYMALKINS
DESC:Graymalkins are magical creatures that resemble ordinary cats. To the casual observer, a graymalkin appear  to be nothing more than a raggedy-looking cat with nothing unusual about it. This disguise aids the graymalkin
in its travels, allowing it to move unmolested among living creatures.

Graymalkins always dwell near populated areas, preferring cities to towns, towns to villages, and so on. They often choose an owner (a living creature they deem gullible and easily manipulated) and convince that creature to take them home with them (by using their fascination ability). Once inside their owner's house, a graymalkin uses its special abilities to kill its owner and any other family members. Such attacks usually occur at night (in the case of the slinker) or over a period of time (in the case of the tether).

Graymalkins are often found serving as the familiar to an evil spellcaster or hag. They prefer females to males when serving as a familiar and very rarely do they ever use their special abilities against their true owner. (Some tales say that when a graymalkin is serving as a familiar, its master is actually immune to its special abilities.)

Graymalkins avoid  direct  confrontations with  opponents,  preferring to attack helpless or otherwise unobservant foes. If forced into battle, a graymalkin seeks escape as quick as possible.

All graymalkins possess the following ability.

AAA	KEY:Graymalkin ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GraymalkinRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Fascination (Su): Once per round as a standard action, a graymalkin can attempt to fascinate a single opponent. The target can make a successful Will save to resist the attempt. On a successful save, that target is immune to the fascination ability of that graymalkin for 24 hours.  If the save fails, the target becomes fascinated with the graymalkin and "adopts" it as a pet, becoming its new owner. The owner clings to the cat and always keeps it close by, feeling withdrawn and lethargic if the graymalkin is farther away. A fascinated target resists any urges or suggestions to rid itself of its new found friend, even to the point of becoming combative and enraged. This fascination lasts until the graymalkin is killed, the owner dies, or the graymalkin remains more than 20 feet away from its owner for at least 24 hours. The effect is otherwise similar to a charm person spell (caster level equals the graymalkin's HD). A graymalkin can only ever have one owner at a single time. If it uses its fascination ability against another creature, that target becomes its new owner on a failed save. All fascination effects on its previous owner are immediately dispelled. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:Gryph ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GryphRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Attach (Ex) When a gryph hits with its legs, its talons latch tightly onto the target, anchoring it in place. An attached gryph is effectively grappling its prey. The gryph loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 11, but holds on with great tenacity and gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls with its bite. Alternatively, an attached gryph can attempt to implant eggs in the target. An attached gryph has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached gryph can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself-if its prey manages to win a grapple check or Escape Artist check against it, the gryph is removed.

AAA	KEY:Gryph ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GryphRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Implant Eggs (Ex) Once per day, a gryph can implant eggs into a helpless target or a target that it is currently attached to as a full-round action by extending an ovipositor from its abdomen and penetrating the victim's flesh by making a successful +4 melee attack. On a hit, the ovipositor inflicts 1 damage and implants 1d4 eggs into the victim's body. As long as a victim has gryph eggs implanted in his body, he is sickened as the eggs draw nutrients from his blood and flesh. The eggs grow swiftly, hatching in a mere 1d4 minutes into ravenous baby gryphs that immediately burrow out of the victim's body. This inflicts 2 points of Constitution damage per baby gryph, after which the hatchlings immediately take wing and fly away.  Treat a gryph hatchling as a bat if statistics are needed.  Gryph eggs can be cut out of a victim's body with a successful DC 20 Heal check made as a full-round action that inflicts 1 point of damage per attempt. Although immunity to disease offers no special protection against gryph egg implantation, remove disease or heal immediately destroys any implanted gryph eggs.

Hallucinatory Spores (Ex) As a standard action, a hangman tree can release a cloud of spores in a 50-foot radius spread. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or be affected as if by a charm monster spell for 2d6 minutes. Affected creatures believe the tree to be of some ordinary sort (or to be a treant or other such friendly tree creature). An affected creature becomes passive and refuses to attack the hangman tree during this time. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  An affected creature can attempt a new Will save (DC 19, +1 per previous save) each round.

If the vine is currently grappling a target, the hangman tree takes a -4 penalty on its opposed attack roll to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a vine deals no damage to a hangman tree.

AAA	KEY:Haunt ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HauntRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Alternate Form (Su) A haunt's natural form is that of a translucent image appearing much as the person did in life. As a standard action, it can alter its form so as to appear as a floating, luminescent ball of light (possibly being mistaken for a will-o'-wisp in this form). In this form, it cannot use its Dexterity damage attack or its malevolence attack. It retains its incorporeal form and can make an incorporeal touch attack that deals normal damage (but not Dex damage).  A haunt remains in one form or the other until it chooses to assume a new one (as a standard action). A change in form cannot be dispelled. A haunt cannot change forms while using its malevolence attack (that is, while possessing a host).

AAA	KEY:Haunt ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HauntRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Malevolence (Su) Once per round, a haunt can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane whose Dexterity has been reduced to 0 (either through the haunt's touch or by some other means). This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th or the haunt's Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the haunt must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 14 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same haunt's malevolence for 24 hours.  If the save fails, the haunt vanishes into the target's body (whose Dexterity temporarily returns to normal) and attempts to complete its unfinished task.  If the haunt completes its task, it leaves the host and fades away forever. When the haunt leaves the host, the host's Dexterity drops back to 0. If the host body is slain while the haunt is in possession of it, the creature becomes tied to that area and can never leave. Its unfinished task remains the same.

AAA	KEY:Haunt ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HauntRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Rejuvenation (Su) In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a haunt through simple combat: the "destroyed" spirit restores itself in 1d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to permanently destroy a haunt is to use dispel evil/good/law/chaos (depending on the haunt's alignment) or determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different ghost by the GM.

AAA	KEY:Haunt ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HauntRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Strangle (Su) If a creature possessed by a haunt has an alignment opposite to that of the haunt on either the law/ chaos or good/evil axis, it attempts to strangle the host using its own hands (i.e., the hands of the host body). Unless precautions are taken to restrain the possessed victim's hands, they immediately reach for the throat and begin strangling the haunt-possessed body. An opponent takes 1d4 points of damage each round until its hands are forcibly restrained with a successful CMB check, the haunt is ejected from the body, or the victim dies.

AAA	KEY:Haunt ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HauntRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Vulnerability (Ex) A haunt can be forcibly ejected from a host if hold person is cast on the victim and the haunt fails its Will save. A dispel evil/good/law/chaos spell (depending on the haunt's alignment) instantly ejects the creature from the host and deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the haunt. A haunt slain in such a manner cannot rejuvenate and is permanently destroyed.

AAA	KEY:MatureHelixMoth ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MatureHelixMothRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Drone (Ex) The rapid beating of the helix moth's wings creates a droning sound that is audible up to 60 feet away. This droning clouds the minds of all creatures within 30 feet that hear it except other helix moths. A successful DC 21 Will save negates the effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  On a failed save, a creature suffers a -4 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, checks and saves for 1 minute. After this time, a new save can be attempted (same DC) if the helix moth's droning can still be heard and the creature is within range. If this save fails, the creature remains affected for another one minute. This continues every minute until a successful save is made or the combat ends. A creature that makes a successful Will save is unaffected by the droning of that helix moth for one day. The droning is a free action so long as the helix moth is airborne. On the ground, it may beat its wings as a move action with the effects as above.

Engulf (Ex) If a hell moth grapples an opponent it can wrap a Medium or smaller creature in its wings and body and automatically deal bite damage in each round it maintains the grapple. Attacks that hit an engulfing hell moth deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.

AAA	KEY:HellMoth ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HellMothRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Immolation (Su) A hell moth that has engulfed an opponent can detonate its body in a blast of hellish fire that deals 6d10 points of fire damage to itself and the engulfed opponent (no save). (Reduce the damage dealt to the hell moth by its fire resistance.) A hell moth can immolate itself once every 3 hours (providing it survives the immolation).  Creatures within 10 feet of the hell moth when it uses this ability must succeed on a DC 17 Reflex save or take 1d8 points of fire damage as clothes and combustibles ignite. The damage continues for another 1d4+4 rounds after the hell moth uses this ability or until the fire is extinguished. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Inphidian

Somewhere in humanities lost aeons a race of malformed serpentine humanoids rose, now known as inphidians. While the truth of their origins has been long forgotten, most sages subscribe to one of two theories. The first states the creatures are the failed results of horrific experiments performed by the dark and nameless sorcerers of an ancient snakecult in their attempts to ensorcel their followers. The second theory contends the inphidians were once a cult of snakeworshippers cursed by an ancient snake-god for some transgression against the ethos. Whatever the truth, it appears as of late that the inphidians have evolved into true race, beyond the machinations of arcane experiments or curses. While there exist several known species, recent reports describe encounters with yet unidentified inphidians and others are sure to surface as encounters with the race grow more frequent.

All inphidians, regardless of the subspecies, have viper heads in place of their hands. The creatures use these in combat to deliver a powerful bite that injects the victim with poison. Inphidians, particularly the craftsmen, wear special gloves called inphidian gauntlets that let them use their hands like any other humanoid with five digits (including an opposing thumb) uses its hands. See the sidebar for details on inphidian gauntlets.

AAA	KEY:Kelpie ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KelpieRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Charm (Su) Once per day, a kelpie can produce an effect identical to the charm monster spell (caster level 9th). The target can make a DC 17 Will save to avoid the effects. If the save fails, the victim believes the kelpie to be a very beautiful and attractive creature, and attempts to move as quickly as possible toward the kelpie.  The kelpie can automatically grapple a charmed foe and attempts to drown the victim. A charmed foe does not resist the kelpie's embrace, and the drowning attempt does not allow an additional save. Female creatures are immune to the kelpie's charm ability; only males can be affected. The charm is negated if the victim dies, the kelpie dies, or dispel magic, greater dispelling, miracle, or wish is cast on the victim. If the save is successful, the target cannot be affected by that kelpie's charm or charm touch for 24 hours.  The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

AAA	KEY:Kelpie ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KelpieRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:

The second form is a hippocampus (see that entry). The third form is a Large green horse. In each form, the kelpie retains all of her special abilities. She does not truly alter her form (such as shapechangers do), she simply reshapes her body. In all of her forms, the kelpie's skin/fur has a greenish cast, and her features are slightly distorted. The kelpie's ruse can be detected if an opponent who is not charmed succeeds on a DC 10 Perception check.

AAA	KEY:Khargra ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KhargraRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Earth Glide (Ex) A khargra can glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth, including metal, as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing khargra flings the khargra back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save.

AAA	KEY:Khargra ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KhargraRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Rend Armor (Ex) If a khargra hits with a bite attack, it deals normal bite damage and pulls apart any metal armor worn by its foe. This attack deals 2d8+2 points of damage to the opponent's armor. Creatures wearing no armor or non-metal armor are unaffected by this special attack (though they still take normal bite damage). Armor reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed and devoured by the khargra.  Damaged armor gains the broken condition.

AAA	KEY:Khargra ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KhargraRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Sundering Bite (Ex) A khargra can making a sunder attempt with its bite attack against an opponent's weapon or shield without provoking attacks of opportunity. Resolve this using the normal rules for a sunder attempt. If the khargra succeeds on its CMB roll, it deals 2d8+2 points of damage to the weapon or shield. Note, against a khargra, a weapon or shield's hardness is only one-half as effective as normal. This means that a light steel shield, for example, is considered to have a hardness of 5 rather than 10 against a khargra's sunder attack. A weapon or shield reduced to 0 or less hit points is destroyed and half of it is swallowed by the khargra.  It only uses this special attack against metal weapons and shields. Damaged armor and weapons gain the broken condition.

AAA	KEY:Khargra ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KhargraRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Vulnerabilities (Ex) A khargra takes maximum damage from a heat metal spell (no save). A transmute metal to wood deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to a khargra. It can attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC 17 + caster's ability modifier) to reduce the damage by half.

Animate Hair (Su) A korred can weave its hair (contained in its pouch) into animated ropes that can entangle foes. The time it takes to weave enough hair to entangle one foe is dependent on the size of the creature as follows: Size | Time || Up to Tiny | 1 round || Small or Medium | 2 rounds || Large | 3 rounds || A korred cannot entangle an opponent of greater than Large size. This ability otherwise is similar to the animate rope spell (caster level 15th)

Soul Capture (Su): Any living creature reduced to below 0 hit points while within 60 feet of a lantern goat must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or have its soul drawn into the lantern goat's lantern. The DC increases by +1 for every hit point the character is below 0 (e.g., a character at -3 hit points must save at DC 20). Once captured, the lantern goat slowly digests the creature's soul over a period of 1 hour, using it to fuel its dark energies. A creature slain in this manner can only be returned to life by a resurrection, true resurrection, wish, or miracle. Raise dead has no effect on such a slain creature. If the lantern goat is slain and the lantern destroyed, the soul is released back to the body if still living. The lantern cannot be destroyed or removed until the lantern goat is destroyed.

Likewise a lava child can simply walk through metal doors or walls as though they did not exist.  All attacks against a metal-armored foe are considered melee touch attacks as the lava child's attacks simply pass through the metal armor.

Chill (Su) A lich shade's claws inflict an additional 1d6 points of cold damage on a hit, and any creature that takes this additional cold damage must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round by the numbing chill. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:LichShade ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:LichShadeRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Death Throes (Su) When a lich shade is destroyed, it explodes into a burst of choking dust. All creatures within 10 feet must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution damage from the violent choking and necromantic scouring of this supernaturally vile dust. Those who fail the save are also nauseated for 1d6 rounds, while those who succeed are merely sickened for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:LichShade ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:LichShadeRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Spell Leech (Su) Whenever a spellcaster within 50 feet of a lich shade casts a spell, the spellcaster must make a DC 20 Will save or the spell is lost, as if it were counterspelled. The lost spell's energy is transferred to the lich shade, who can use the magical energy in one of the following three ways. A lich shade can only store the energy of one spell at a time.  Cast: A lich shade can cast the spell on his turn at caster level 11th. When casting spells in this manner, he ignores the spell's material component requirements, but not its focus requirements.  Eldritch Bolt: A lich shade can release the spell as an eldritch bolt of pure magic energy as a standard action (range 50 ft., ranged touch +12, 1d6 damage per 2 levels of the spell used to create it).  Healing: A lich shade can absorb the spell's energy to heal hit points equal to the spell's level 4. Hit points in excess of his maximum are instead gained as temporary hit points.  These temporary hit points last for 1 hour before fading.

AAA	KEY:LichShade ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:LichShadeRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Spell Sense (Su) A lich shade can automatically pinpoint the location of any spellcaster within 100 feet who has cast a spell within the previous round. It can also identify spells as they are being cast and all existing spell effects as if it were under the effects of greater arcane sight.

Engulf (Ex) A livestone that has engulfed an opponent can instantly solidify its form, dealing 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage per round to the trapped victim (DC 17 Fort half).  The save DC is Strength-based.  An engulfed creature can be freed by killing the livestone or by casting stone to flesh on the livestone. This deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the livestone and automatically ejects an engulfed victim.

AAA	KEY:Livestone ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:LivestoneRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Solidify (Ex) A livestone can solidify all or part of itself into a material with the hardness and consistency of solid rock. A solidified part of a livestone has a hardness of 8 and a break DC of 50. A livestone can effect the solidification as a free action. An opponent attacking a livestone must succeed on a DC 19 Reflex save each time his attack hits. If the save is failed, the livestone actually solidifies the portion of its body at the instant it was hit, thus applying its hardness rating of 8 to any damage it takes. A livestone cannot attack if its entire form is solidified. The save DC is Strength-based.

Engulf (Ex) A living lake that has grabbed an opponent can try to engulf the creature in its body. This ability functions as swallow whole, except for the following changes. An engulfed creature is trapped in the living lake's body, where the ooze inflicts automatic slam damage each round. In addition, an engulfed foe has no air to breathe and must hold its breath or risk drowning (see the Pathfinder Core Rulebook for rules on drowning). A living lake can engulf 1 Gargantuan, 2 Huge, 8 Large, 16 Medium, 32 Small, 64 Tiny, 128 Diminutive, or 512 Fine creatures. If an engulfed creature cuts its way free, living lake simply flows together again and can still use its engulf attack.

A magnesium spirit gains 5 temporary hit points for each negative level bestowed. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Negative levels remain for 24 hours, after which time the host can attempt a DC 16 Fortitude save to remove a negative level.

AAA	KEY:MagnesiumSpirit ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagnesiumSpiritRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Soul Portal (Su) This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 8th), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the magnesium spirit must try move into the target's space; moving into the target's space to use this ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 17 Will save. If the save fails, the magnesium spirit vanishes into the target's body. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus from the creature's Ability Focus feat.  A magnesium spirit that has possessed an opponent's body deals a negative level to the host each round (see its energy drain attack above). When the host drops below 1st level, both it and the magnesium spirit vanish in a flash of white light as the spirit completes the ritual needed to return it to its plane of origin. Neither is ever seen again.  Each round, as a standard action, while the magnesium spirit inhabits its body, the host can attempt to eject the creature by making an opposed Wisdom check against the magnesium spirit's Wisdom check. If successful, the magnesium spirit is ejected and cannot use its soul portal ability against that creature again for 1 hour.  A magnesium spirit can be damaged by holy water even while merged with its host. Holy water deals 2d4 points of damage per vial to the creature. If it takes half or more of its current hit points in damage from holy water, it is ejected from the host's body. The host is stunned for 1d3 rounds.

AAA	KEY:Mantidrake ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MantidrakeRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Breath Weapon (Su): A mantidrake's breath weapon depends on what type of dragon parent it had, as summarized on the table below. Regardless of its type, a mantidrake's breath weapon is usable once every 1d4 rounds, deals 5d8 points of damage, and allows a DC 19 Reflex save for half damage.  The save DC is Constitution-based.  To determine a mantidrake's draconic parent and breath weapon randomly, roll 1d10 and consult the table below.  1d10 | Draconic Parent | Breath Weapon || 1-2  | Black | 60-foot line of acid || 3-4  | Blue  | 60-foot line of lightning || 5-6  | Green | 30-foot cone of gas (acid) || 7-8  | Red   | 30-foot cone of fire || 9-10 | White | 30-foot cone of cold ||

This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other. The creature can launch only twenty-four spikes in a single day.

histle (Su) A marble snake can whistle, gaining the attention of any creature within 50 feet that hears it. All creatures (other than marble snakes) with the area must succeed on a DC 11 Will save or become entranced.  This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same marble snake's whistle for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.  An entranced victim walks toward the marble snake, taking the most direct route available. If the path leads into a dangerous area, that creature gets a second saving throw. The effect continues for as long as the marble snake whistles and for 1 round thereafter. An entranced victim is effectively dazed (cannot attack, but can defend). If an entranced opponent is attacked, the effect is immediately broken. A bard's countersong ability allows the entranced creature to attempt a new Will save.

AAA	KEY:Mawler ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MawlerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Magic Aura (Su) A mawler continuously emits a moderate aura of transmutation magic. This ability can be negated or dispelled (versus caster level 6), but the mawler can activate it as a free action on its next turn.

AAA	KEY:Mawler ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MawlerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Mimic Shape (Ex) A mawler can assume the general shape of any object that is roughly Tiny sized. A mawler's body is fleshy and pliable, but it can alter the rigidity of its body to resemble metal, wood, and even stone. Most mawlers have found that taking on the shape of articles of clothing provides the most ready meals. The ruse can be detected by a Perception check opposed by the mawler's Disguise skill.

AAA	KEY:Mawler ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MawlerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Vorpal Bite (Ex) A mawler that scores a critical hit with its bite attack while being worn severs the extremity that was inside it at the time. For example, a mawler being worn as a boot that scores a critical hit, severs the victim's leg. A mawler can only use its vorpal bite while being worn.  A creature that loses a limb suffers a -4 penalty to skill checks that require the use of two limbs. For example, a victim that loses a hand or arm suffers a -4 penalty to Climb checks, Disable Device checks, and so forth. Additionally, a creature that loses its primary weapon-wielding arm or hand suffers a -6 penalty when wielding a weapon in its offhand. A creature with the Two-Weapon Fighting feat that loses its primary arm or hand ignores the penalty for wielding a weapon in its offhand.  If the victim loses a foot or leg, the penalty applies to Acrobatics checks and the like. Additionally, the creature's speed is reduced to one-quarter. If the severed extremity happens to be the head, the victim dies immediately (unless it can live without its head).

Mind Flood (Su) As a standard action and by touching an opponent, a memory child floods the opponent's mind with every single thought the child has ever collected from those that have come into contact with it. This effect overloads the opponent's brain dazing it for 1d6+2 rounds and confusing it for 1 hour (treat as a confusion spell, caster level equals the memory child's Hit Dice). A successful DC 16 Will save negates the stunning effect and reduces the confusion effect to 1 minute. The save DC is Constitution-based. This ability is always active but can be suppressed or restarted by the memory child as a free action.

AAA	KEY:MemoryChild ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MemoryChildRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:

Water from other sources, such as spells or effects that create water but do not specify an amount in gallons, deal 1d4 points of damage per caster level to a lightning mephit within its area of effect.

Disgorge Vermin (Ex): Once per day as a standard action, a mire brute can vomit forth a spray of fetid water to a range of 30 feet. The spray contains small biting insects and worms. Treat these vermin as a centipede swarm (Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary). A mire brute disgorges 1d3 centipede swarms when it uses this ability.

Impale (Ex): A mire brute can try to impale a grabbed opponent of one size smaller than itself by making a successful grapple check that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If successful, the opponent immediately takes 4d6 points of damage and is impaled on the stakes jutting from the mire brute's body. An impaled opponent is considered pinned and thereafter takes 3d6 points of damage each round until it breaks free. An impaled opponent must succeed on a grapple check against the mire brute's CMD to break free. A mire brute is not considered grappled while it has an opponent impaled. A Huge mire brute can impale 1 Large, 2 Medium, 8 Small, or 32 Tiny or smaller opponents at one time.

Vermin Empathy (Ex) This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy, save that a mite can only use this ability on vermin. A mite gains a +4 racial bonus on this check. Vermin are normally mindless, but this empathic communication imparts on them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing mites to train Medium vermin and use them as mounts.

Bay (Su) A moon dog can produce one of the following effects when it howls or barks. Each effect functions as the spell of the same name (caster level 12th). The save DCs are Charisma-based.  Fear: All evil creatures within 80 feet must make a successful Will save or be affected as by a fear spell. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. If the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected by the fear effect of that moon dog's bay for 24 hours.  Dispel Evil: This effect works like the spell, and affects one evil extraplanar creature within 80 feet.  Dismissal: This effect works as the spell, except that it targets one evil extraplanar creature.

Create Spawn (Su) Any living creature slain by a mortuary cyclone's necrocone attack or energy drain attack becomes an undead creature in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are under the command of the mortuary cyclone that created them and remain enslaved until its destruction. See the sidebar for the type of undead creatures a mortuary cyclone can spawn.

AAA	KEY:MortuaryCyclone ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MortuaryCycloneRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Desecrating Aura (Su) A mortuary cyclone emanates an aura of desecration within a 50-foot radius centered on its body.  This functions as a desecrate spell (caster level 18th) as if the mortuary cyclone where a permanent fixture dedicated to its own deity. Clerics in the area take a -6 profane penalty on turning checks, undead within the area gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves, and undead created within the area have +2 hit points per HD. Further, anyone casting animate dead within 50 feet of a mortuary cyclone creates as many as double the normal amount of undead (4 HD per caster level instead of 2 HD per caster level).  A consecrate spell cast on a mortuary cyclone by a caster of 18th level or higher nullifies its desecrating aura for 1 minute per caster level.

AAA	KEY:MortuaryCyclone ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MortuaryCycloneRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Necrocone (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a mortuary cyclone can blast forth a mass of bone fragments, debris and negative energy in a 30-foot cone. Creatures caught in the cone take 6d6 points of damage. Half this damage is piercing damage, but the other half is from negative energy and is not subject to resistance or immunity (unless the opponent is resistant or immune to negative energy effects). An affected creature that succeeds on a DC 27 Reflex save reduces the piercing damage by half. Undead within the area of a necrocone heal a number of hit points equal to the amount of negative energy damage (3d6) the attack would otherwise deal. An undead creature cannot gain temporary or bonus hit points from a mortuary cyclone's necrocone. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:MortuaryCyclone ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MortuaryCycloneRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:

Attach (Ex) When a giant mosquito hits with a touch attack, it uses its legs to latch onto the target, anchoring it in place. An attached giant mosquito is effectively grappling its prey. The giant mosquito loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 13, but holds on with great tenacity and inserts its proboscis into the grappled target's flesh.  A giant mosquito has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached.  An attached giant mosquito can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself-if its prey manages to win a grapple check or Escape Artist check against it, the giant mosquito is removed.

AAA	KEY:GiantMosquito ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GiantMosquitoRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Blood Drain (Ex) A giant mosquito drains blood at the end of its turn if it is attached to a foe, inflicting 1d4 points of Constitution damage. Once a giant mosquito has dealt 4 points of Constitution damage, it detaches and flies away to digest its meal. If its victim dies before the giant mosquito's appetite has been sated, the giant mosquito detaches and seeks a new target.

AAA	KEY:GiantMosquito ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GiantMosquitoRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Welt (Ex) The bite of a giant mosquito forms an irritating welt on the affected area that imposes a -2 conditional modifier to skill checks for one day if the opponent fails a DC 10 Fortitude save. A DC 10 Heal check or any cure spell negates the penalty. Both the save DC and check DC are Constitution-based.

Acid (Ex) A mudbog secretes a digestive acid that quickly dissolves organic material, but not metal or stone. Any melee hit deals 1d6 points of acid damage. Armor or clothing dissolves and becomes useless immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 17 Reflex save. A wooden weapon that strikes a mudbog dissolves immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 17 Reflex save. The mudbog's acidic touch deals 17 points of acid damage per round to wooden objects, but the ooze must remain in contact with the object for 1 full round to deal this damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:Mudbog ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MudbogRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Camouflage (Ex) The consistency and coloration of a mudbog makes it difficult to discern from a normal patch of mud. Any creature within 10 feet of a mudbog must make a DC 20 Perception or Survival check to determine the actual nature of the creature.

AAA	KEY:Mudbog ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MudbogRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Engulf (Ex) A Medium or smaller opponent that walks into a mudbog is automatically grappled and takes 1d6 acid damage each round the mudbog maintains the hold.  Engulfed creatures are considered to be grappled and are trapped within the mudbog's body. This ability otherwise functions as swallow whole, save that a creature that cut its way out of a mudbog leaves no hole in the protoplas creature's body.

Engulf (Su) Once per minute as a standard action, a mudman can hurl itself at any creature of its size or smaller within 10 feet. If it succeeds on a ranged touch attack, the mudman immediately makes a CMB check to grapple the target (this does not provoke an attack of opportunity) with a +4 racial bonus. If the mudman fails to establish a hold, it drops into an adjacent square and is staggered for 1 round. If the mudman establishes a hold, it flows over its opponent, covering the creature with its muddy body-it can attempt a new CMB check to maintain the "hold" on the creature each round that follows as a free action. The creature is effectively blinded and must either hold its breath or suffocate as long as the mudman retains its hold. Each round the mudman maintains its hold, it deals 1d4+3 points of damage as it crushes and constricts its victims.

AAA	KEY:Mudman ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MudmanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Magic Vulnerability (Ex) Mudmen are particularly susceptible to dispel magic, as this spell disrupts the magical energies in their bodies. A mudman subjected to dispel magic takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (Fortitude save for half damage). Transmute mud to rock deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to any mudmen caught in the area of effect and leaves them staggered until they can find a new mud pool. Other, similar spells may have similar effects.

AAA	KEY:Mudman ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MudmanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Mud Bomb (Su) A mudman can hurl globs of its muddy body mixed with its surrounding mud-this attack has a range increment of 10 feet. If one of these mud bombs hits a target, it quickly grows semi-solid and tenacious, causing 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. If the cumulative Dexterity damage from mud bombs ever equals the target's actual Dexterity score, the target remains conscious but is held immobile and cannot take any physical action (although see below) until the mud is removed or the target breaks free. Spell-like abilities or spells with only verbal components may be used if the trapped creature can make a DC 20 concentration check. It's a DC 20 Strength check (made as a full-round action) to pry accumulated mud off and remove all Dexterity damage caused by the attack-a creature that is held immobile can break free with a DC 25 Strength check made as a full-round action (this is the only physical action the creature can attempt while encased in mud). The mud dries and crumbles to dust in 15 minutes, or in 1d3 rounds if a large amount of water (such as results from a casting of create water) is used to wash it away.

AAA	KEY:Mudman ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MudmanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Mud Pool (Su) A mudman cannot leave the bounds of the mud pool it dwells in, although these mud pools may be of any size. A mudman's tremorsense extends throughout the entire mud pool, and it gains a +16 bonus on Stealth checks when hiding in a mud pool. A mudman forced out of its mud pool is staggered.

AAA	KEY:AAA ~ Mudman	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MudmanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:
A mudman's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

AAA	KEY:MummyoftheDeep ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MummyoftheDeepRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Curse of the Deep (Su) On a successful grapple check against a creature up to its size, a mummy of the deep presses its lips against an opponent's and regurgitates sea water into the opponent's lungs.  Each round thereafter, for the next 10 rounds, the victim must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of damage that round. Three consecutive successful saves means the character has coughed up enough water to shake the effects of this attack and takes no further damage. An affected creature can take no actions other than to defend itself in any round it takes damage from this ability. At 0 or less hit points, the victim falls unconscious. In the next round, he drowns. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Holding one's breath does not prevent drowning (water is already in the lungs). A remove curse, heal spell, or successful DC 20 Heal check halts the damage if applied before the creature reaches 0 or less hit points.

AAA	KEY:MurderBorn ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MurderBornRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Despondent Wail (Su) As a standard action, a murder-born can unleash a child-like wail. Any living creature within 60 feet that hears the wail must make a successful DC 16 Will save or be overcome with supernatural feelings of hopelessness. A powerful curse falls upon the victim and they become so despondent that they need to make a successful DC 16 Concentration check in order to motivate themselves enough to make an attack or cast spell. The curse is permanent, though a remove curse or break enchantment (both requiring a successful caster level check against DC 18) or a limited wish, wish, or miracle can remove the effects of curse. The save DC is Charisma-based. Whether or not the save is successful, an individual cannot be affected by a murderborn's despondent wail for the next 24 hours.

AAA	KEY:Oakman ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:OakmanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Shillelagh (Su) Any oaken club or staff wielded by an oakman automatically gains the benefits of the shillelagh spell (caster level 5th). The oakman does not have to cast this spell to get the benefit; its effects are automatic as long as the club or staff is in the oakman's hands. (This benefit is already included in the statistics block above.) In anyone else's hands, the oaken club or staff functions as a normal weapon of whatever type it is.

AAA	KEY:Oakman ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:OakmanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Moss (Ex) Using his unique knowledge of plants and herbal mixtures, an oakman can concoct unusual cakes from tree moss. A typical oakman has 1d6 moss cakes of random type on his person. These moss cakes have a variety of effects and must be eaten by the target creature to take effect. Saves (where applicable) have a DC of 15.

AAA	KEY:Oakman ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:OakmanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Moss Cake-Ability Score Damage: The victim suffers 1d6 points of ability damage to a random ability (determined when the moss cake is created). One day after eating the moss cake, if the victim doesn't receive a restoration spell, it must make another successful save or one point of the ability damage is actually drain.

AAA	KEY:Oakman ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:OakmanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Moss Cake-Coloration: This moss cake is quite harmless when eaten and does nothing more than cause the victim's skin to become spotted. The spots can be of just about any color, though most tend to be brown, red, or blue. The spots last for 1 hour before fading.

AAA	KEY:Oakman ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:OakmanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Moss Cake-Healing: This moss cake heals the target as by a heal spell cast by a 5th-level cleric.

AAA	KEY:Oakman ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:OakmanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Moss Cake-Lethargy: The victim falls into a state of apathy and becomes sluggish if it fails a Fortitude save. The effects last for 30 minutes. While affected, the victim moves at one-half its normal speed and suffers a -2 circumstance penalty to AC and on attack rolls, checks, and saves.

AAA	KEY:Oakman ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:OakmanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Moss Cake-Pain: Eating this moss cake wracks the victim with pain for 1d4 hours if it fails a Fortitude save. During this time, the victim suffers a -2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and ability and skill checks.

AAA	KEY:Oakman ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:OakmanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Moss Cake-Poison: Eating this moss cake poisons the victim (ingestion; save Fort DC 15; effect 1d6 Con, cure two consecutive saves).

AAA	KEY:Oakman ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:OakmanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Moss Cake-Sleep: This moss cake puts the victim to sleep for 1 hour (as the sleep spell) if it fails a Fortitude save.

AAA	KEY:Oakman ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:OakmanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Tree Dependent (Su) An oakman is mystically bonded to a single, enormous tree and must never stray more than a mile from it. An oakman who moves more than a mile from his bonded tree immediately becomes sickened. Every hour thereafter, he must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to resist becoming nauseated for an hour. An oakman that is out of range of his bonded tree for 24 hours takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage, and another 1d6 points of Constitution damage every day that follows-eventually, this separation kills the oakman. An oakman cannot forge a new bond with a new tree; if his tree is destroyed, he will eventually sicken and die.

AAA	KEY:Oakman ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:OakmanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Tree Stride (Su) At will, an oakman can create an effect identical to that of the tree stride spell (caster level 5th). Oakmen can only travel through oak trees. This ability can be negated or dispelled, but the oakman can restart it on its next turn.

AAA	KEY:ObsidianMinotaur ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ObsidianMinotaurRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Magic (Ex) An obsidian minotaur is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature as noted below.  A transmute rock to mud spell slows it (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its hit points.  A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the obsidian minotaur's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round.

ORCS
DESC:Orc tribes are feared and reviled throughout the planes for their depravities and their penchant for destruction and mindless violence. The vast majority of orcs are easy enough to identify by their jutting jaw, yellowed tusks, squinting eyes and hairy, brutally muscular frames. Their skin color tends to run the gamut from blue-black to grey, with  putrid slime green being the most common. Many tribes of orcs however have adopted traits unique to their own species through interbreeding with other races, adaptation to climate and terrain, and the intervention of evil magicians or other-planar powers.

AAA	KEY:Phantasm ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PhantasmRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Possession (Su) Once per round, by making a successful incorporeal touch attack, a phantasm can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell, except that it doesn't require a receptacle. If the attack succeeds, the phantasm's body vanishes into the opponent's body. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save (DC 21). A creature that successfully saves is immune to that phantasm's possession ability for one day.  A possessing phantasm automatically deals one negative level (from its energy drain ability) each round. A possessed creature can attempt a Will save (DC 19) each round to force the phantasm out of its body. If successful, the phantasm is ejected from the host and cannot attempt to possess the same host for 1 minute. If turned or subjected to a dismissal spell while possessing a host, the phantasm is likewise ejected. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Burn (Ex) Anyone touching (or touched by) a phantom stalker must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or take an extra 1d6 points of fire damage as clothes ignite or armor becomes searing hot. The damage continues for another 1d4+4 rounds after the phantom stalker's last successful attack. Phantom stalkers can also ignite flammable materials with a touch. The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:PhantomStalker ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PhantomStalkerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Death Throes (Ex) A phantom stalker reduced to 0 hit points or less expels a fiery blast equivalent to a fireball (caster level 6th) that deals 6d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within 20 feet. A DC 15 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based.  A phantom stalker never uses this ability if it would harm the one that summoned it, unless the summoner itself is to blame for the phantom stalker's destruction (i.e., if the summoner attacks the stalker or orders it into battle against opponents that clearly outmatch it).

AAA	KEY:PhantomStalker ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PhantomStalkerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:

Flames of Healing (Ex) Any magical attack against a phantom stalker that deals fire damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the phantom stalker to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.

The Will save has a DC of 21and the Fortitude save has a DC of 21. A creature that succeeds on its Will save is immune to the phantasmagoria attack of that phasma for 24 hours. The save DCs are Charismabased.

Natural Invisibility (Su) This ability is constant, allowing a poltergeist to remain invisible even when attacking. This ability is inherent, cannot be dispelled or negated, and is not subject to the invisibility purge spell.

AAA	KEY:Poltergeist ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PoltergeistRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Rejuvenation (Su) Like ghosts, it's difficult to destroy a poltergeist through simple combat: the "destroyed" spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Unlike ghosts, powerful spells such as dispel evil usually are effective. Short of that, however, the only way to permanently destroy a poltergeist is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different poltergeist or group of poltergeists by the GM.

AAA	KEY:Poltergeist ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PoltergeistRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Telekinesis (Su) A poltergeist can create a telekinetic effect to hurl one object or creature within 10 feet to a distance of 60 feet (no range increment). This ability functions as the violent thrust version of the telekinesis spell (caster level 10th) with the following exceptions: the poltergeist can hurl only one object or creature per round; the poltergeist uses its Charisma modifier (usually +2) to modify its base attack bonus. A creature targeted by this ability can make a DC 13 Will save to avoid being hurled by the poltergeist. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:Poltergeist ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PoltergeistRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Unnatural Aura (Su) Both wild and domesticated animals can sense the unnatural presence of a poltergeist at a distance of 30 feet. They will not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain panicked as long as they are within that range.

AAA	KEY:Proscriber ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ProscriberRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Condemn (Su) Once per day, as a melee touch attack, a proscriber can sever the connection between a divine caster and his or her deity. The target can attempt a DC 22 Will save (to negate the effects. If the save fails, the divine caster loses the ability to cast divine spells, turn or rebuke undead, smite good or evil, and loses the use of other divine-based spell, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. Even if the save succeeds, the divine caster touched takes 10d6 points of damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Additionally, one that fails its save resists all beneficial divine spells (such as heal, or any cure spell) and effects cast on him or her. A creature attempting to cast a beneficial divine spell on a condemned creature must make a successful DC 20 caster level check or the spell has no effect on the condemned creature.  The effects of this ability are permanent but can be removed by the casting of a remove curse spell followed by an atonement spell. The one casting the remove curse and atonement spells must be a divine caster who worships the same god as the condemned and who is of a class level equal to or higher than the condemned.

AAA	KEY:BloodPudding ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BloodPuddingRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Disgorge (Ex) A blood pudding that has infused itself with a host can force the creature's blood out through its pores, eyes, ears, and mouth. This is a standard action that deals 1d2 points of Constitution damage each round.  At Constitution 0, the host dies and the blood pudding feeds on the corpse. When sated, the pudding exits, and to onlookers it appears as if the slain creature is bleeding profusely.

AAA	KEY:BloodPudding ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BloodPuddingRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Infuse (Ex) A blood pudding that makes a successful grapple check can forcibly merge its form with that of a living creature. If it succeeds, the blood pudding's form disappears as it soaks through skin, wounds, and any other opening in the host's body. This special attack deals no damage but allows the blood pudding to use its disgorge special attack (see above).  A creature infused with a blood pudding can try to forcibly eject the creature once per round as a standard action (coughing it up, vomiting, and so on). This requires a successful DC 17 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based.  A creature can be affected by the pudding's infuse attack again, but gains a +2 conditional bonus on its Fortitude save. This bonus lasts for one day and is effective against the infuse attack of that blood pudding only.

AAA	KEY:BloodPudding ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BloodPuddingRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Racial Vulnerabilities (Ex) Drinking alcohol weakens an infused pudding and reduces the Constitution damage sustained from its disgorge attack by one-half for the next 1d4+1 rounds.  Consuming pure vinegar causes an infused blood pudding to eject itself from the host in the same round the vinegar is consumed. A creature drinking pure vinegar must make a successful DC 12 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d3 rounds. A blood pudding will not use its infuse attack against that host for one day.  A blood pudding hit with a cold effect or attack is slowed for 3 rounds (as the slow spell) and loses its racial bonus to grapple checks for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level.

AAA	KEY:BloodPudding ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BloodPuddingRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

The reaction is so violent that all creatures within 5 ft. of the acid quasi-elemental when the water hits it must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or take the same damage. Pouring water onto an acid quasi-elemental requires a successful ranged touch attack. Water from other sources, such as spells or effects that create water but do not specify an amount in gallons, deal 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level to an acid quasi-elemental within its area of effect. Damage from waterbased attacks, like the slam attack of a water elemental, is increased by 50% against an acid quasi-elemental. Note that this reaction does not occur when the acid quasi-elemental touches water, only when water touches the acid quasi-elemental.

A typical quickwood (11 HD) has 9 roots it uses to grab foes. For every 2 HD above 11, a quickwood has one additional root it can use in combat (thus, a 13 HD quickwood has 10 roots and a 15 HD quickwood has 11 roots).

AAA	KEY:Quickwood ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:QuickwoodRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Fear Aura (Su) If a quickwood is targeted by a spell (excluding area spells) and it makes its save against the spell's effects, it takes no damage and absorbs some of the spell's energy and releases it as a fear effect (as a free action) in a 10-foot radius per level of the spell. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or be affected as by a fear spell (caster level 11th). The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.

AAA	KEY:Quickwood ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:QuickwoodRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Grasping Roots (Ex) If a quickwood hits with a root attack, it can attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and drags the foe 30 feet closer each subsequent round (provoking no attack of opportunity). A quickwood can draw in a creature within 15 feet of itself and bite with a +4 attack bonus in the same round. A root has hardness 2 and 10 hit points and can be attacked by making a successful sunder attempt. However, attacking a quickwood's root does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the root is currently grappling a target, the quickwood takes a -4 penalty on its CMD to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a root deals no damage to a quickwood.

AAA	KEY:Quickwood ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:QuickwoodRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Fire (Ex) A quickwood can perspire as a free action; this grants it immunity to fire for one hour.  Afterwards, it must wait one minute before using this ability again.

AAA	KEY:Quickwood ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:QuickwoodRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Remote Sensing (Su) As a standard action, a quickwood can use a normal oak tree within 360 feet as a magical sensor to view its surroundings. This ability is similar to a clairaudience/clairvoyance spell and allows a quickwood to see (including with darkvision) and hear through a sensor.

Tormenting Howl (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a raggoth can loose a piercing howl that affects all creatures within 60 feet that hear it. A creature within the area must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or become shaken for 2d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds on its save is immune to the tormenting howl of that raggoth for 24 hours.

If a rakkelthorn toad is killed or subdued before it has fired all of its thorns in a given day, the poison can be extracted from its remaining thorns. A successful DC 16 Heal or Craft (alchemy) check allows the poison to be changed into a mild anesthetic; one rakkelthorn toad provides enough for one dose. A single dose of this anesthetic, applied to the wound of an injured creature, provides a +2 circumstance bonus to Heal checks (multiple doses do not stack). This bonus lasts for one hour, after which time the anesthesia wears off. Poison cannot be extracted from thorns that have been fired by the rakklethorn.

Thorns (Ex) From its back, the rakklethorn toad can fire a volley of thorns once per round as a standard action. All thorns in the cluster either hit or miss their target and deal 1d6 points of damage plus poison (see above). This attack has a range of 50 feet with no range increment. The rakklethorn toad can launch a total of 6 such volleys per day.

Fear Cackle (Su) A red jester can unleash a fear-inducing cackle as a free action. All creatures within 60 feet that hear it must make a successful DC 22 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. Panicked creatures suffer a -2 morale penalty on saves and flee (if possible). A panicked creature has a 50% chance to drop what it's holding. If cornered or unable to flee, a panicked creature cowers. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to that red jester's fear cackle for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:RedJester ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RedJesterRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Jester's Deck (Su) The red jester uses a deck of playing cards in combat that functions as a deck of many things (Pathfinder RPG core rulebook, 544-555). Once per round, as a standard action, the red jester can draw a single card and throw it at an opponent to a range of 20 feet. This requires a successful ranged touch attack. If successful, the card takes effect that round and affects the target just as if he had drawn a card from a deck of many things. A red jester can draw the same card more than once. The playing cards only function in the hands of a red jester. To anyone else, they are merely normal playing cards.

AAA	KEY:ReliquaryGuardian ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ReliquaryGuardianRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Alignment Subtype (Ex) Because a reliquary is infused with a spark from their creator's deity, the creature gains the appropriate subtype(s) based on its alignment. Thus, a lawful good reliquary guardian has both the Good and Lawful subtypes. In addition, a reliquary guardian's weapons and natural attacks can overcome this type of damage reduction as if its weapons and natural attacks had an alignment (or alignments) that match the reliquary guardian's subtype(s).
Further, its damage reduction is based on its alignment subtype(s). Thus a chaotic evil reliquary guardian has damage reduction 10/lawful and good while a lawful good reliquary guardian has damage reduction 10/chaotic and evil.

AAA	KEY:ReliquaryGuardian ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ReliquaryGuardianRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A reliquary guardian is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against a reliquary guardian, as noted below.  A dispel (chaos/evil/good/law) spell targeted against an appropriately aligned reliquary guardian deals 4d6 points of damage to it.  A blasphemy spell heals an evil-aligned reliquary guardian of all its lost hit points. Likewise, a dictum spell heals a lawaligned reliquary guardian; a holy word spell heals a goodaligned reliquary guardian; and a word of chaos spell heals a chaos-aligned reliquary guardian.

AAA	KEY:ReliquaryGuardian ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ReliquaryGuardianRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Magic Weapon (Ex) A reliquary guardian carries a +1 greatsword with an alignment special quality that matches its alignment on the good-evil axis or the law-chaos axis. Thus, a chaotic evil reliquary guardian might carry a +1 anarchic greatsword or a +1 unholy greatsword while a lawful good reliquary guardian would carry either a +1 axiomatic greatsword or a +1 holy greatsword.

Pronouncement (Su) Once per day, a reliquary guardian can make a pronouncement that affects all creatures within 60 feet that hear it. This pronouncement otherwise functions as a blasphemy, dictum, holy word, or word of chaos spell. Note: a reliquary guardian only has one type of pronouncement. It is set during the construction process based on the creator's alignment and the reliquary guardian's alignment and cannot be changed.

AAA	KEY:ReliquaryGuardian ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ReliquaryGuardianRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:
Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A reliquary guardian has a total of five spell-like abilities (one each of spell levels 1st thru 5th), each usable once per day. Its spell-like abilities are based on its alignment and are drawn from one of the following cleric domains: Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law. A reliquary guardian whose alignment is CE, CG, LG, or LE must be assigned a single domain (one that matches one of its alignment axes) during construction. This domain can never be changed.  Regardless of the reliquary guardian's alignment, its spelllike abilities function at caster level 16th. The save DCs are Wisdom-based.

Construction

Reliquary guardians are created for a specific purpose, be it the guarding
of a saint's tomb or protection of a detailed item or place of religious significance to its creator and the creator's deity. A reliquary guardian is crafted from 3,000 pounds of purest marble which is sprinkled with various exotic powders. The total cost is at least 5,000 gp for its body. The color of the marble it is crafted from denotes the predominant alignment of the deity and creator: white marble (good-aligned), green marble (chaos-aligned), red marble (law-aligned), black marble (evil-aligned).

AAA	KEY:StoneRoper ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:StoneRoperRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Stony Hide (Ex) A stone roper's tough hide renders it immune to damage from nonmagical ranged attacks, save those of unusually large size (such as boulders hurled by a giant).

AAA	KEY:StoneRoper ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:StoneRoperRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Strands (Ex) Most encounters with a stone roper begin when it fires up to six strong, sticky strands up to 50 feet away (no range increment). A roper's attacks with its strands are treated as ranged touch attacks. Strands can be severed by any amount of slashing damage (a strand is AC 20). Once a strand has successfully struck a victim, it remains attached until severed or retracted by the stone roper (which it may do as a free action). Attached strands do no further Strength damage, but the struck individual is subject to the pull effect each round, and is subject to the stone roper's venom pulse ability.  A creature that begins its turn attached to a strand is numbed and weakened by the strange material, and for each strand attached must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Strength damage. The save DC is Constitution-based, and poison resistances and immunities apply.

AAA	KEY:StoneRoper ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:StoneRoperRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Venom Pulse (Ex) Twice per day, a stone roper can exude a pulse of venom through all of its attached strands as a free action. A creature attached to a strand must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be paralyzed (multiple attached strands to not require multiple saves or increase the save DC). A paralyzed creature appears to have been turned to stone (DC 20 Spot check or close inspection reveals that this is in fact not the case). One round after being paralyzed, the victim recovers and must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or act as if under the effects of a charm monster spell for 2d4 minutes. A charmed creature fights for and defends the stone roper. If the stone roper is killed, a charmed victim acts as if under the effects of a confusion spell for 1d6+2 rounds. The save DCs are Constitution-based, and poison resistances and immunities apply.

AAA	KEY:SandKraken ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SandKrakenRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Tentacles (Ex): The only part of a sand kraken that is normally exposed is its tentacles. For combat purposes, the creature's tentacles are treated as separate weapons.  A single tentacle has an AC 20 (touch 14) and 15 hit points. Once a tentacle takes more than 15 hit points of damage, it is destroyed. A sand kraken can no longer use the destroyed tentacle to make attacks, however the loss of a tentacle cause the creature no other penalties. Furthermore, damage dealt to a tentacle does not count against the creature's total hit points. Lost tentacles regrow in 1d4 days.

AAA	KEY:SandStalker ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SandStalkerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Attraction (Ex) The front four legs of a sand stalker are hollow. When a gust of air or wind blows across them, they create a hypnotic sound that can be heard by all creatures within a 100-foot spread. Those hearing this sound must make a successful DC 15 Will save or become entranced. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. If the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same sand stalker's attraction for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.  An entranced victim takes the most direct route possible, walking toward the sand stalker. If the path leads into a dangerous area, (fire, over a cliff, and so on), that creature gets a second saving throw. Entranced creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the sand stalker stands there and offers no resistance to the monster's attacks. The effect continues for as long as the sand stalker's legs are subjected to wind. A bard's countersong ability allows the entranced creature to attempt a new Will save.

Note that the approach or animation of the scarecrow does not count as an obvious threat to the victim of this particular fascination effect (although the scarecrow's attack does count as an obvious threat and ends the fascination). This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

A successful save leaves the victim shaken for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The Save DC is Charisma-based.

Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be dazed for one round. The save DC is Charisma-based. The effects of multiple screaming devilkin using their scream ability in an overlapping area is not cumulative; only one save need be made each round. Conversation, even shouting, is inaudible within 60 feet of a screaming devilkin using this ability.

Cacophony (Su) When a screaming skull detects movement within 40 feet, it emits an ear-shattering roar of tumultuous sounds as a free action that can be heard up to 1,000 feet away. All creatures within 60 feet that hear the sound must make a successful DC 13 Will save or take 1d6 points of sonic damage each round they remain in the area. The screaming also distracts spellcasters attempting to cast spells. A spellcaster within the area must make a successful Concentration check (DC 10 + sonic damage taken) to successfully cast a spell. The screaming lasts for 1d4 rounds before ceasing for one round. After that, the skull remains silent unless a creature is within or moves within 40 feet of it-it then screams again and repeats the above cycle. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Additionally, this cacophonous scream risks attracts wandering monsters. Whenever the skull first screams, the GM makes an additional wandering monster check to determine if nearby creatures come to investigate the source of the disturbance.

AAA	KEY:ScreamingSkull ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ScreamingSkullRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:

AAA	KEY:Scylla ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ScyllaRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Boil Water (Ex) If a scylla uses its heat ability (see below) for 3 consecutive rounds and doesn't move more than 5 feet from its current location, the water surrounding it (in a 10-foot radius and to a depth of 10 feet) begins to rapidly churn and boil. Creatures caught in the boiling water take 3d6 points of fire damage each round they remain in the area. A successful DC 22 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. Creatures wearing heavy clothing or medium or heavy armor take a -2 penalty on their saving throw. In addition, those wearing metal armor or coming into contact with very hot metal are affected as if by a heat metal spell. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Once the scylla moves from its location or shuts its heat ability off, the boiling water takes 3 rounds to return to its normal temperature (it still deals full damage during its cooling off period). A scylla is immune to its own boil water ability and to the boil water ability of other scyllas.

AAA	KEY:Scylla ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ScyllaRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Heat (Ex) A scylla raises the temperature of its body in order to generate intense heat. It does so as a free action. Creatures attacking a scylla unarmed or with natural weapons take 1d6 points of fire damage each time their attacks hit. In addition, a scylla can use its heat ability to boil the surrounding waters.

AAA	KEY:Scylla ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ScyllaRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Scalding Blast (Ex) A scylla can gulp some of the boiling water surrounding it as a move action. Each head that gulped water can then unleash a line of scalding steam on the scylla's next action to a range of 50 feet. The scylla can target the same or different opponents with each head, if it wishes. Each blast deals 3d6 points of fire damage or half that amount if the target succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. The save DC is Constitution-based. This is effective both on the surface and underwater.  In any round that a head does not gulp water, it can bite.

AAA	KEY:Scylla ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ScyllaRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

SEA SERPENTS
DESC:Nearly as old as the dragons that roam the sky are the sea serpents, great snakelike creatures that have roamed the oceans for ages. Unlike the classical dragon, these great, scaly, serpentine beasts are generally agreed to be a product of evolution, though many suspect magical influence, either deliberate or natural, somewhere in their evolution.

Whatever their origins, sea serpents are a highly varied species, with a great variation in size, coloration, intellect, and temperament. However, all sea serpents bear certain similarities. They are long, serpentine, warmblooded creatures that closely resemble snakes in appearance, though they all have two sets of flippers, which may be large or so small and atrophied as to be nearly unnoticeable. Sea serpents are aquatic creatures, though some can make their way about on land. All sea serpents can breathe both water and air with equal efficiency, another fact that distinguishes them from marine mammals and reptiles. Further, all sea serpents are sentient, with an intellect ranging from little greater than moronic to supra-genius level.

One trait that sea serpents share in common with their draconic brethren is a sense of innate superiority, a feeling that they are masters of the sea, at least in whatever manner they choose to pursue their expertise.

Unlike dragons, however, sea serpents are not distinguished by color or age category. And while some species are as acquisitive as dragons, others have no interest in hoarding wealth, and live lives little better than beasts.

All sea serpents can speak and understand Aquatic, and many know Draconic as well. The more intelligent species may also learn the languages of marine civilizations, or the languages of sea-traveling surface dwellers. Due to their physical similarities, sea serpents use fairly consistent tactics in combat situations. All sea serpents have venomous bites, and they use this to their advantage to slow or immobilize multiple attackers so they can concentrate on one foe. In addition to their lethal bite, all sea serpents have the ability to ensnare prey in their coils as a giant constrictor does and crush the life out of them. The larger sea serpents may even use this constriction attack against sea vessels, and mariners in their smoky dens delight in recounting tales of horror and woe of great serpents that splinter hulls and then devour the helpless sailors in the water.

Because they are sentient beings, sea serpents can often be reasoned with, even if the reasoning is no more complex than simple intimidation. They are adaptable to circumstances, and none throw themselves into battle rashly.

Feats: All sea serpents have Swim-By Attack as a bonus feat.

Cocoon (Su) Three times per day, a sepia snake can fire a line of webbing to a range of 20 feet. A creature caught in the path can make a successful DC 20 Reflex save to avoid the web. On a failed save, the opponent is wrapped in the snake's webbing. When a foe is completely covered in webbing, it must make a successful DC 20 Fortitude save or be placed in a state of suspended animation as per the sepia snake sigil spell for 1d4+12 days. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  In one round, the sepia snake can spit enough webbing to cover one Medium or smaller creature. For each size category larger than Medium, the snake must fire another line of webbing to completely encase an opponent. Victims hit by the webbing, but not completely covered, can break free in one round by making a successful DC 24 Strength check or DC 20 Escape Artist check. Each 5-foot section of webbing has 10 hit points. The check DCs are Constitution-based and the Strength check includes a +4 racial bonus.  A foe completely wrapped cannot break the webs and must rely on others to get free.

AAA	KEY:SlagWorm ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SlagWormRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Deafening Roar (Su) Whenever a slag worm moves at least half of its speed in a single round it creates a grinding roar of metal on metal from its body. Creatures within 50 feet that hear this grinding roar must succeed on a DC 30 Fortitude save or be deafened for 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:SlagWorm ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SlagWormRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Intense Heat (Ex) A slag worm's body generates intense heat. Anything within 10 feet of its body takes 4d6 points of fire damage each round. A DC 30 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. Any weapon that strikes a slag worm must succeed on a DC 30 Fortitude save or melt into slag. (Magic weapons gain their enhancement bonus to their save.) A creature striking a slag worm with a natural attack or unarmed takes the same 4d6 points of damage each time an attack hits. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:SlagWorm ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SlagWormRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Fire Absorption (Ex) Fire deals no damage to a slag worm. Instead, the slag worm absorbs the effect and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points the effect would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the slag worm to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.

The sleeping willow heals 5 points of damage whenever it drains Constitution, gaining temporary hit points (if bonus hit points exceed the sleeping willows total). At Constitution 0, the creature dies and its body is absorbed by the sleeping willow's roots. The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:SleepingWillow ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SleepingWillowRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

Engulf (Ex) A slithering tracker can engulf a paralyzed foe up to one size larger than itself as a standard action. It cannot make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. The slithering tracker merely has to move into a space occupied by a paralyzed creature, completely covering it.  An engulfed opponent is subjected to the slithering tracker's paralysis and plasma drain, and is considered to be grappled and trapped within its body.  A slithering tracker only uses this ability against a paralyzed, sleeping, or otherwise helpless opponent.

AAA	KEY:SlitheringTracker ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SlitheringTrackerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Plasma Drain (Ex) A slithering tracker drains the body fluids from an engulfed opponent. Each 5 minutes an opponent is engulfed, it takes 1 point of Constitution damage. Because it takes a long time to completely drain a foe, a slithering tracker generally only uses this ability against a paralyzed, stunned, held, or sleeping opponent.

If a soul eater's victim (i.e., the creature it is summoned to slay) is killed before the creature can devour its soul, the soul eater returns at full speed to the caster and attacks him. Likewise, if a soul eater is defeated in battle (but not slain) by its target, the creature returns to the caster and attacks him. So long as both the caster and soul eater are on the same plane of existence, the soul eater can successfully locate the caster (again as though guided by discern location). If the caster leaves the plane, the link is temporarily broken. Once the caster returns, or the soul eater enters a plane the caster is on, the link is immediately restored.

This effect is similar to a trap the soul spell. The save DC is Charisma-based.  A creature's soulless body collapses into a desiccated husk, and in one day crumbles to dust.  To reclaim a captured soul, the reaper must be destroyed and its scythe shattered on consecrated ground. When the scythe is shattered, all souls trapped are released and seek their original body (if it's been less than one day since the body was killed). Creatures without a body are left to wander in spirit form but can be returned to life through the successful casting of a miracle, wish, or true resurrection spell.

AAA	KEY:SoulReaper ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SoulReaperRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Inseparable Weapon (Su) A soul reaper has a mystic and magical connection to its scythe. If separated from its scythe (if the soul reaper is disarmed, for example) and within 100 feet of it, it may summon it to its hands as a move action. If an opponent is holding the weapon when the reaper summons it, that opponent must succeed on a DC 26 Strength check or the weapon flies from its hands to the soul reaper. The check DC is Charisma-based.

Spriggan
DESC:Spriggans are among the ugliest and certainly the most foul tempered of all gnomes. At one moment a normal-sized gnome, a spriggan can grow to giant-sized in an instant, gaining immense strength and taking unsuspecting opponents by surprise.

Spriggans are, by human standards, quite homely. They have stocky bodies and sickly ochre-colored skin and dark hair of brown of black. Male spriggans favor facial hair such as shaggy mustaches and ratty beards, but any head or facial hair they have is unkempt and filthy. Female spriggans do not have facial hair. Being unhygienic creatures, spriggans never bathe or clean their clothing or equipment. Thanks to their filthy lifestyle, spriggans reek with the foulness of dirt, body odor, and other unpleasantness. Despite being gnomes themselves, spriggans despise all of their gnomish kinfolk.

A typical spriggan stands 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs 50 to 55 pounds. An enlarged spriggan stands about 8-1/2 feet tall and weighs 500 to 550 pounds.

Spriggans make the best use of their magical abilities in combat. When several spriggans are encountered, some will enlarge themselves at the first sign of melee, while the remainder will stay Small and take advantage of their innate abilities of stealth and sneak attacks. Owing to their chaotic nature, complex battle plans are generally beyond most spriggan mobs; it is likely that some, none, or all spriggans in a mob will change size at the start of melee.

Size Alteration (Su) At will, a spriggan can grow from Small to Large size or back again. Weapons, armor, and other inanimate objects on its person grow proportionately with it when it changes size. This is similar to the enlarge person spell. An enlarged spriggan gains +12 Strength, -2 Dexterity, +6 Constitution, and a -2 to AC.

Sea Sprite

Sea sprites are the aquatic version of normal sprites. As their name implies, they are joyful fey who dwell in the sea. Their hair resembles strands of seaweed and they have large, fish-like eyes. The skin of a sea sprite is pale blue. Lacking wings, sea sprites cannot fly, but thanks to fine webbing in their fingers and toes they are adept swimmers. Sea sprites can breathe both air and water without difficulty. Like normal sprites, sea sprites make use of special ammunition that put their opponents to sleep. Sea sprites have the same statistics as their land-dwelling brethren, with the following exceptions: They have the aquatic and amphibious subtypes; they do not have a fly speed but have a swim speed of 30 feet, and their Swim score is +12 (Swim score is based on their Dexterity, not their Strength). They employ crossbows rather than shortbows, and prefer spears over short swords.

Fronds (Ex) Strangle weed attacks with fronds that can extend up to 20 feet from its central mass. Each strangle weed has 3-12 fronds. A strangle weed attacks with these fronds as a slam attack; although it can make only one attack per round, if it grapples a foe it is not denied its Dexterity bonus against non-grappled foes and can still make attacks of opportunity if it has any free fronds. Once a foe is grappled, the strangle weed can attempt to latch on 1-4 additional fronds each round as a standard action by means of a separate grapple check. Additional fronds attached to a foe do not do increased damage, but they do add a cumulative +2 bonus to the strangle weed's CMB on subsequent grapple checks against that foe. To free itself, the foe must succeed on a grapple check against every frond grappling it.

AAA	KEY:Tshann ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TshannRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Alien Thoughts (Su) The alien brainwaves of a t'shann have a bizarre effect on intelligent creatures. Within 30 feet of a t'shann, all opponents with an Intelligence score greater than 5 must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be affected as if by a confusion spell (caster level equal to the t'shann's HD). If the opponent approaches to within 10 feet he must succeed on another DC 13 Will save or take 1d4 points of Intelligence damage for as long as he remains within 10 feet of the t'shann. Once the opponent moves more than 10 feet from this effect, his Intelligence score immediately returns to normal, although any confusion effects remain until he moves more than 30 feet away. Psionic monsters and creatures, being attuned to the brainwaves of others, suffer these effects at double the normal range. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Once the burrow is located, the t'shann can be lured out by placing small pile of gems at the entrance. The t'shann must succeed on a DC 10 Will save or shuffle out of its lair to consume the treats.

AAA	KEY:Tangtal ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TangtalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Duplicate (Su) As a standard action, a tangtal can create an effect similar to a mirror image spell (caster level 12th).  This allows the tangtal to create up to eight images of itself. The images can move up to 30 feet away from the tangtal, but each must be within 10 feet of another image. The tangtal can use this ability once per day and it otherwise resembles the mirror image spell.

Frightening Exuviation (Ex) If a tazelwurm is hit by a fire attack or effect that deals at least 10 points of damage, it takes no damage, but instead allows its scales, flesh, and fur to be consumed and burned away in a single round, exposing its skeletal structure. A creature viewing this must make a successful DC 15 Will save or paralyzed with fear for 1d3 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same tazelwurm's frightening exuviation for one day. This has no effect on other tazelwurms.

AAA	KEY:TemporalCrawler ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TemporalCrawlerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Slowing Webs (Ex) The web of a temporal crawler emanates a slow effect (as the slow spell, caster level 6th) that affects all creatures within 10 feet of the web. Affected creatures can make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save the round they are affected to negate the effects.  Creatures are slowed as long as they stay within 10 feet of a web. The slow effects can be counterspelled with the successful casting of a haste spell if the caster makes a successful caster level check (DC 16) before casting the haste spell. The save DC is Constitution-based.  A temporal crawler can fire a web up to four times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets up to one size category larger than the temporal crawler.  An entangled creature can attempt a DC 19 Escape Artist check or burst it with a DC 19 Strength check. Both are standard actions. The check DCs are both Constitution-based and the Strength check DC includes a +4 racial bonus.  Temporal crawlers often create sticky sheets of webbing up to 20 feet square. Approaching creatures must make a successful DC 20 Perception check to notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot section has 10 hit points, and sheet webs have damage reduction 5/ magic.

Creatures of 2 HD or less are not only driven mad but are also compelled to worship the tentacled horror as a god (as if affected by a charm person spell, caster level 12th). Only a restoration, greater restoration, miracle, or wish spell can restore the mind of one driven insane by a tentacled horror.

Paralysis (Ex) The digestive fluid injected by a tentamort's stinging tentacle is coupled with a paralytic poison as well that forces the victim to make a DC 13 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for one minute. Immunity to poison negates this effect.

AAA	KEY:Tentamort ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TentamortRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Liquefy Organs (Ex) A tentamort can insert the needlelike projection from its stinging tentacle into the body of a foe grappled by either tentacle. Doing so requires a successful melee attack, and the tentamort cannot insert the projection into a creature grappled with its constricting tentacle if its stinging tentacle is also grappling a foe.  Once inserted, the tentamort injects a digestive liquid and a paralytic poison (see above) through the hollow barb that liquefies the victim's internal organs; the tentamort draws this liquefied slurry back through the hollow needle into its own body to feed. This attack deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round the tube remains inserted in a foe.  Once the needle is removed or the tentamort is killed, the foe continues to take 1 point of Constitution damage until it succeeds at a DC 13 Fortitude save. This Constitution damage can be halted by spells or effects that remove disease or heal ability score damage (including lesser restoration).

AAA	KEY:TimeFlayer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeFlayerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Foresight (Su) A time flayer can see a few seconds into the future. This ability prevents a time flayer from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or flanked. It also grants the time flayer an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom bonus. This ability can be negated, but the time flayer can restart it as a free action on its next turn.

AAA	KEY:TimeFlayer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeFlayerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

AAA	KEY:TimeFlayer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeFlayerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Reality Bend (Su) As a free action, a time flayer can fold the dimensional space surrounding it so its true location is hard to discern. Attackers have a 50% miss chance each time they attack with melee or ranged weapons. This is similar to the miss chance granted by a displacement spell. See invisibility does not reveal the creature's location, but true seeing does.

AAA	KEY:TimeFlayer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeFlayerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Temporal Displacement (Su) As a melee touch attack, a time flayer can send a creature a few seconds into the future. A DC 18 Fortitude save negates. The save is Constitution-based.  On a failed save, the creature disappears in a flash of white energy only to reappear in the same space 1d4 rounds later. This effectively removes that creature from combat for the duration. If the space is occupied when the creature returns, it suffers no damage and is shunted aside. The time flayer can use this ability three times per day.

AAA	KEY:TimeFlayer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeFlayerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Time Jaunt (Su) As a standard action, a time flayer can slip through the time stream and appear anywhere on the same plane of existence as if by greater teleport. This ability transports the time flayer and up to four other creatures within a 30-foot radius that the time flayer designates.  Unwilling creatures can attempt a DC 18 Will save to avoid being carried away. This ability is otherwise similar to the greater teleport spell. The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:TimeFlayer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeFlayerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Unmaking (Su) An opponent slain by a time flayer is unmade-erased from the very fabric of time. No memories or recollections of the unmade creature exist anywhere in reality. Past events the creature was responsible for are now attributed to an unknown-even if they recently took place. For example, suppose a great hero saved a kingdom from certain doom and then suffers the unmaking. The kingdom is still safe, but no one can quite recall who saved it.  A creature that suffers the unmaking cannot be raised, resurrected, or restored to life by any means-not even a wish can restore an unmade creature. Only the direct intervention of a deity can restore one who suffers this fate.

AAA	KEY:TombstoneFairy ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TombstoneFairyRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Danse Macabre (Su) Once per night, a tombstone fairy can invoke a ritual to raise any evil creature from the dead. The ritual takes 10 minutes to perform and the target cannot have been dead longer than one day per HD of the tombstone fairy. Additionally, the target's body must be present during the ritual and its soul must be available for return (that is, if the target's soul is trapped, such as by a trap the soul spell, this ritual automatically fails).  A target unwilling to return to life can prevent its raising by making an opposed Charisma check against the tombstone fairy's Charisma check. If the tombstone fairy wins the check, the target's soul is forced into its body a it returns to life. If the target wins the opposed check, it prevents its raising, and the tombstone fairy cannot atte to raise that same target for one month.  During the ritual a portion of the target's soul transfers to funeral shroud or cloth. The tombstone fairy often retains shroud so as to force compliance from the returned tar Once the target does what the fairy desires, the tombst fairy finishes this ritual and transfers the last bit of the targ soul from the shroud into its body. If the funeral shroud is destroyed while it contains a part of the target's soul, the target instantly dies and can only be returned to life through the use of a resurrection, true resurrection, miracle or wish.  This ability otherwise resembles a raise dead spell.  A tombstone fairy can have only one funeral shroud (containing a target's soul) in its possession at one time.

AAA	KEY:Transposer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TransposerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Blending Disguise (Ex) When using its disguise self spell-like ability, the transposer can make itself look like a creature of the humanoid or monstrous humanoid type. When disguising itself, the transposer ignores the usual penalty for different race, age category, and gender. Finally, transposers gain a racial bonus equal to one half their racial Hit Dice to the Will save DC to penetrate the illusion of their disguise self ability.

AAA	KEY:Transposer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TransposerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Transposition (Su) An opponent hit by a transposer's slam attack becomes linked (transposed) to it by an invisible and undetectable field of energy for 1 hour if it fails a DC 14 Fortitude save. A transposer can have a number of opponents equal to its HD linked to it at one time. An opponent can be linked to more than one transposer (if it fails its save against each transposer's attack). The save DC is Constitution-based.  When a linked opponent attacks a transposer it is linked to, the creature gains hit points equal to the damage the attack would normally deal, and the attacker takes the damage. Other opponents linked to that transposer are unharmed. A transposer can gain up to the maximum hit points allowed by its Hit Dice. It cannot gain bonus or temporary hit points from this ability.  Curative magic cast on a transposer by a transposed opponent damages the creature by the amount it would normally heal, and heals a like amount of damage on the one who cast the spell. (Other linked creatures are unaffected.) Curative magic cast on a transposed opponent works normally but does not heal or harm a linked transposer. Curative magic cast on a transposer by a non-linked opponent functions normally.  Opponents not linked to the transposer can attack and affect the creature normally.

Camouflage (Ex) Since a tri-flower frond looks like a normal flowering plant when at rest, it takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the plant.

AAA	KEY:TriFlowerFrond ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TriFlowerFrondRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Fluid Drain (Ex) Against a sleeping or helpless foe, a tri-flower frond can release a needle-sharp tendril from its red bloom that pierces its target and drains its body fluids. This deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round, and the victim is considered grappled.

AAA	KEY:TriFlowerFrond ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TriFlowerFrondRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Sleep Pollen (Ex) A creature struck by one of the tri-flower frond's tendrils must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or fall into a deep, coma-like slumber from which it cannot be awakened that lasts for 1-4 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based. Resistances and immunities to poison apply against the pollen, but resistances or immunities to sleep effects do not. A slumbering victim can also be awakened by a successful DC 20 Heal check after one minute of treatment.  A creature that falls victim to the sleep pollen is subject to the tri-flower frond's acid and fluid drain attacks, both as free actions.

AAA	KEY:Tsathar ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TsatharRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Implant (Ex) Tsathar are sexless, reproducing by injecting eggs into living hosts. An egg can be implanted only into a helpless host creature. The host must be of Small size or larger. Giant frogs, bred for this very purpose, are the most common host. Implanting an egg requires one minute to perform.  Accompanying the egg is an anaesthetizing poison that causes the host to fall unconscious for the two-week gestation period of the egg unless the host succeeds on a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw; this save DC includes a +8 racial bonus. If the save succeeds, the host remains conscious, but is violently ill (-10 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks) 24 hours before the eggs hatch. When the eggs mature, the young tsathar emerges from the host, killing it in the process.  A remove disease spell rids the victim any implanted eggs. A DC 20 Heal check can be attempted to surgically extract an egg from a host. If the check fails, the healer can try again, but each attempt (successful or not) deals 1d6 points of damage to the patient.

AAA	KEY:Tsathar ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TsatharRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Leap (Ex) Tsathar are incredible jumpers, able to leap up to 30 feet horizontally or 10 feet vertically. They have a +14 racial bonus on horizontal jumps, or +24 on vertical jumps, and they do not need to make a 10-foot minimum running start before jumping to avoid doubling the jumping DCs. Tsathar can always take 10 when making an Acrobatics check to jump.  When a tsathar begins its round by jumping next to an opponent it can make a full attack in the same round. A tsathar wearing medium or heavy armor or carrying a medium or heavy load cannot use this ability.

AAA	KEY:Tsathar ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TsatharRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:
Summon Hydrodaemon (Sp) A tsathar with at least five levels of cleric can, once per day, attempt to summon a hydrodaemon (q.v.) with a 40% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.

AAA	KEY:Tsathar ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TsatharRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Slimy (Ex) Because tsathar continuously cover themselves with muck and slime, they are difficult to grapple. Webs, magic or otherwise, do not affect tsathar, and they usually can wriggle free from most other forms of confinement.  This grants them a +12 racial bonus to their CMD to escape grapples, and to their Escape Artist checks.

Capsize (Ex) A giant bog turtle can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a charge attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher.  For each size category the ship is larger than the bog turtle's size, the giant bog turtle takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check.

AAA	KEY:GiantBogTurtle ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GiantBogTurtleRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Current (Ex) As a full round action, a giant bog turtle can induce a strong current by opening its mouth and inhaling large quantities of water. This strong rush of water lasts for 5 rounds and affects all in a cone-shaped area to a range of 100 feet. Creatures and objects of up to Large size are pulled toward the bog turtle at the rate of 20 feet per round. Affected creatures can make a Swim check (DC 30) to resist the current. A swimming creature cannot take 10 on its Swim check. The check DC is Strength-based.

AAA	KEY:GiantBogTurtle ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GiantBogTurtleRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Shell (Ex) If it is severely threatened a giant bog turtle can completely withdraw into its shell, leaving it almost completely impervious to attack. When withdrawn, a giant bog turtle gains the benefit of cover (+4 AC against melee and ranged attacks). Since it cannot move when withdrawn into its shell, a bog turtle does not gain the +2 bonus to Reflex saves normally granted by cover.

-----------------------------------------------

Turtle-Shark
DESC:From a distance this creature resembles a giant snapping turtle. It has a peaked and craggy shell from which protrude four long fins and a scowling head at the end of a long neck. Rather than a turtle's head, however, this creature's head has irrefutably shark-like features. It has round, black eyes and a gaping maw filled with rows of razor sharp teeth. Its head and fins are dark grayish-green. A turtle-shark surprises many foes with its quickness in the water. Many assume that it is as slow as its other shelled kin, and underestimate its shark-like speed. Like its predatory cousins, a turtle-shark attacks nearly anything it can reach, especially if there is blood or activity in the water.

Multiple Personalities (Ex) The three heads of an ubue rarely get along with each other. Due to this division of personalities, there is a 15% chance in any given situation (usually once per encounter) that the heads get into an argument. An ubue engaged in an argument with itself takes a -2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, Reflex saves, and to AC for the duration of the encounter, or until they can reach some sort of accord.  In a non-combat situation, an opponent can coerce an ubue into a self-argument by making a Charisma check opposed by the ubue's Wisdom check. If the ubue wins the opposed check, the character cannot attempt to coerce that ubue again for one day.

Vegepygmy
DESC:This creature resembles a humanoid with green vegetable-like skin and razor-sharp claws. Its head sports two large yellow eyes, a wide mouth, inset nose, and a topknot of dark brown leaves. Leafy tendrils protrude from its shoulders, midsection, arms, and legs.


When a living creature is slain by russet mold (see that entry), it rises as a vegepygmy commoner. Vegepygmies are low-intelligence plants that make their home deep in the forests or underground away from most settled areas. They are hunters and scavengers, and carnivorous, preying on living creatures weaker than themselves.

A vegepygmy ranges from two feet to four and a half feet tall. Though they do not seem to have ears, it is well known that vegepygmies can hear.  Vegepygmies do not speak, but communicate with others of their kind

by thumping their chest or rapping their spears on rocks, earth, or some	other solid surface. It is not known if or how they communicate with other creatures.  Vegepygmies attack with claws or weapons, usually either a longspear or club. They prefer to ambush opponents, using their coloration to	blend with their natural surroundings.

Spores (Ex) The chief is the only vegepygmy with a spore attack. As a standard action, a chief vegepygmy can release a cloud of spores in a 40-foot spread. A living creature caught within the cloud must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 2d6 rounds. After the paralysis wears off, the character must succeed on another DC 17 Fortitude save or take 3d6 points of Constitution damage. This save DC is Constitution-based. At Constitution 0 a creature dies, and rises as a 4 HD vegepygmy bodyguard in one day. If a remove disease spell is cast on a paralyzed victim before the paralysis wears off, he does not have to attempt the second Fortitude save and takes no Constitution damage.

The volt loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 13, but holds on with great tenacity and inserts its proboscis into the grappled target's flesh. A volt has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached volt can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself-if its prey manages to win a grapple check or Escape Artist check against it, the volt is removed.

An opponent struck by a blob of vorin poison spit at them is protected from its effects for a short time by any amount of worn armor-the blob strikes the armor but not the opponent's flesh. The blob of poison seeps through armor in a number of rounds equal to the armor's armor bonus (do not apply any magical bonuses). The blob can be scraped off as a move action. Natural armor does not provide any defense as the poison seeps through the opponent's pores, nor does poison delivered by a vorin's sting have the same delayed effect.

WEIRDS
DESC:Weirds are creatures from the various inner and outer planes (including the demi-, para-, and quasi-elemental planes as well as the elemental planes).

They are sometimes encountered on the Material Plane, often in the employ of a powerful spellcaster. Bribery is the usual means of gaining the services of a weird, though some spellcasters resort to even more deceitful practices or trickery to gain the services of these creatures. Spellcaster beware! Weirds are intelligent creatures and do not take kindly to deception (unless they are the ones engaging in such trickery).

All weirds, regardless of their makeup, are serpent-like creatures about 10 feet long, and being of an evil and malign nature. Weirds speak the common language of weirds and the language native to their home plane. Some speak more languages, and still some can speak Common.

Fungus Pool: A fungus weird's "pool" is not a pool at all, but an entanglement of leaves, branches, mosses, funguses, and plants. A typical pool covers a 20-foot radius, and a fungus weird (being bound to its pool) can never leave this area.  A creature that enters a fungus weird's pool (on its own or with the aid of the fungus weird) is automatically entangled (as the entangle spell) until it escapes. An entangled creature can break free and move half its normal speed by using a full-round action to make a DC 15 Escape Artist check or a DC 19 Strength check.

The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.  This effect is similar to the dominate monster spell. The elemental receives a Will save to avoid being commanded. If the save succeeds, that elemental is immune to the control elemental ability of that lava weird for one day. If the save fails, the elemental falls under the control of the lava weird and obeys it to the best of its ability until either it or the weird dies. There is no limit to the number of HD of elementals a lava weird can control using this ability. The range is unlimited though both the lava weird and the elemental must be on the same plane of existence; otherwise, the weird loses control of the elemental. Lava weirds cannot control other lava weirds using this ability.

AAA	KEY:LavaWeird ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:LavaWeirdRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

Creatures attacking a lava weird unarmed or with natural weapons take fire damage and must make a successful Reflex save to avoid catching on fire just as if the lava weird had hit with its attack.

AAA	KEY:LavaWeird ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:LavaWeirdRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Drown (Ex): If a lava weird pins a grabbed foe, it fully immerses its victim in its lava pool. A victim completely immersed takes fire damage (see Lava Pool below) and must hold its breath or drown. The victim can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to twice its Constitution score. After that, the victim must make a successful Constitution check (DC 10, +1 per previous check) each round to continue holding its breath. If the victim fails a check, it drowns. In the first round, the victim falls unconscious (0 hp). In the next round, the creature is dying (-1 hp), and in the third round the victim drowns.  Lava Pool: A lava weird's pool is a bubbling, churning, morass of molten rock mixed with elemental fire. Flammable materials that contact the lava pool automatically catch fire on the round contact is made. Creatures touching the pool take 2d8 points of fire damage per round of contact. Damage from the lava pool continues for 1d3 rounds after contact ceases, but this extra damage is only half of that dealt during contact (1d8 points of damage). Creatures immune to fire are unaffected by the lava weird's pool and take no damage, though they can still drown if completely immersed.

AAA	KEY:WillowDusk ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WillowDuskRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Aura of Misery (Su) Once every 1d4+1 rounds as a free action, a willow dusk can emit a wave of negative energy that affects all living creatures within 10 feet of it. Creatures within the area take 1d6 points of Charisma damage if they fail a DC 22 Will save. At Charisma 0, a creature collapses into a coma until at least 1 point of Charisma is restored. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:WillowDusk ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WillowDuskRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Droning (Su) Once per round as a standard action, a willow dusk can emit a droning sound audible to a range of 100 feet. Creatures within the area that hear it, must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or enter a state of lethargy. Affected creatures cannot move (as if held by a hold monster spell) and have no desire to take any other action or engage in combat (unless attacked first, in which case the lethargy effect is broken). The effects last for a number of rounds equal to the one-half of the willow dusk's Hit Dice (10 rounds for the typical willow dusk). A willow dusk that attacks a creature affected by this ability gains a +4 bonus on its attack roll. Whether the attack succeeds or fails, the lethargy effect is immediately broken. A creature who succeeds on his Will save is unaffected by the droning from that same willow dusk for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:WindWalker ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WindWalkerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A wind walker is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance (except those that summon or call it). In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature as noted below.  A control weather spell instantly slays a wind walker if it fails a Fortitude save against the spell.  A haste spell deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6) to a wind walker. A Fortitude save halves the damage. In addition, a haste spell increases the damage the wind walker deals with its wind blast attack by +1d6 for one round.  An ice storm spell deals no damage to a wind walker, but is affected as if by a fear spell if it fails a Will saving throw against ice storm.  A slow spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to a wind walker. A Will save halves the damage.  A summoned or called wind walker is affected normally by magical barriers that restrict or inhibit called or summoned creatures (such as antimagic field).

AAA	KEY:WindWalker ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WindWalkerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Wind Blast (Ex) A wind walker attacks using the air surrounding it, transforming it into a forceful blast that deals 2d6+6 points of damage to all creatures within reach. The wind walker makes a single attack roll at its full attack bonus against each opponent within reach as a standard action.

Stench (Ex): A witherstench constantly emits a putrid stench that nearly every form of animal life finds offensive. All living creatures (except witherstenches) within 30 feet of a witherstench must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be nauseated (unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything else requiring attention; can only take a single move action per turn) for as long as they remain within 30 feet of the creature. Moving out of the affected area leaves the character sickened (-2 penalty on all attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks) for 1 round after which time he recovers immediately. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same witherstench's stench for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws.

Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the plant. Dwarves can use stonecunning to notice the subterranean version.

AAA	KEY:Witherweed ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitherweedRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Death Smoke (Ex) A witherweed that takes at least 1 point of damage from a fire effect releases a cloud of deadly smoke that billows forth and quickly fills a 20-foot radius surrounding it. Creatures within the area must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution damage. One minute later, another Fortitude save (same DC) must be made to avoid another 2d6 points of Constitution damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based. The cloud remains for 1 round per HD of the witherweed but a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the cloud in 1 round.

Arcanesense (Su) A wizard's shackle can automatically detect the location of any arcane spellcaster within 30 feet.
This functions in a similar fashion to a detect evil spell but there is no chance the wizard's shackle is stunned and it is not blocked by stone, lead, or other material.

AAA	KEY:WizardsShackle ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WizardsShackleRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Attach (Ex) If a wizard's shackle hits with a bite attack, it latches onto the opponent's body. An attached wizard's shackle is effectively grappling its prey. The wizard's shackle loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 14, but holds on with great tenacity. Wizard's shackles have a +20 racial bonus on grapple checks (already figured into the CMB and CMD entries above).  An attached wizard's shackle can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself. To remove an attached wizard's shackle through grappling, the opponent must achieve a pin against the wizard's shackle.

AAA	KEY:WizardsShackle ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WizardsShackleRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Spell Drain (Su) A wizard's shackle drains spells when attached to an arcane spellcaster. Each round the wizard's shackle remains attached, it drains 1d6 levels of prepared spells or unused slots, beginning with the highest level spell or slot available. For example, on a roll of 4 against a 5th-level wizard, a wizard's shackle drains four levels of prepared spells. The wizard currently has one 3rd-level spell, two 2nd-level spells, and three 1st-level spells prepared. The wizard's shackle drains the 3rd-level spell and one of the 1st-level spells (determined randomly).  A creature drained of spells or slots can attempt a DC 12 Intelligence check with a +2 bonus to notice that something is wrong (though unless he searches his body, he might still overlook the wizard's shackle). Once a wizard's shackle has drained at least 4 spell levels, it detaches and crawls away to digest its meal. Lost spells or slots can be regained normally.

AAA	KEY:ShadowWolf ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ShadowWolfRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Trip (Ex): A shadow wolf can assume a corporeal form as a free action and bite (as a standard action) a foe in an attempt to trip the opponent. A shadow wolf that hits with its bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the shadow wolf. Shadow wolves use their Dexterity modifier on trip attacks.  The shadow wolf remains corporeal (i.e., it loses its incorporeal traits) for the entire round in which it attempts to trip an opponent. It can assume its incorporeal form on its next turn as a free action.

AAA	KEY:ShadowWolf ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ShadowWolfRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Shadow Blend (Ex): In any condition of illumination other than full daylight, a shadow wolf can disappear into the shadows, giving it total concealment. Artificial illumination, even a light or continual flame spell, does not negate this ability; a daylight spell, however, will.

All-Around Vision (Ex) A giant chameleon can rotate each eye, independently of the other, in a 180 degree radius. This gives it a +4 racial bonus on Perception checks, and it cannot be flanked.

AAA	KEY:AAA ~ GiantChameleon	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GiantChameleonRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Superior Vision (Ex) By magnifying an image, a giant chameleon can see five times as far as a normal human. This grants the chameleon a +4 racial bonus on Perception checks. This bonus stacks with all-around vision.

Giant Horned Chameleon

The giant  horned  chameleon  is  a territorial creature  and  is  rarely
encountered with another of its kind except during mating season.

Giant horned chameleons are green or dark green. Males are distinguished by the three large horns protruding from their head. This
grants them a gore attack (1d8 + Strength modifier) that they can use
in lieu of a bite or tongue attack. Females possess the same horns, but they are usually underdeveloped (dealing 1d6 + Strength modifier). These
chameleons have a crest on the back of their head, and bony ridges and spines running the length of their back.

Rock Chameleon

Rock  chameleons  resemble  common  giant  chameleons  but  their natural coloration is gray and they are only found in warm and temperate mountains where their coloration allows them to blend in with their surroundings. They use the stats for the common giant chameleon, but only gain the bonus to Stealth checks in rocky surroundings.

Spines (Ex) A creature that steps on a dragonfish or strikes it with an unarmed strike or a natural weapon takes 1d4 points of piercing damage from the fish's dorsal barbs and is subjected to its poison.

AAA	KEY:AAA ~ Skunk	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkunkRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Musk (Ex) Once per round, and no more than 5 times per day, a skunk can release a cloud of stinking musk that quickly fills a 5-foot area in front of it. A creature within or entering the area must succeed on a DC 10 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. One round later a second Fortitude save must be made (whether the first one succeeded or not) or the affected creature is blinded for 1d4 rounds. The save DCs are Constitution-based. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature, but does not remove the blindness. Creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the sickened effect but can still be blinded if they fail their save, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on both saving throws. The stench is highly potent, and short of magical means of cleaning, all cloth and such material continue to reek for 1d6 months. The odor is so strong that it doubles all chances for random encounters and imposes a -6 penalty on Stealth checks attempted while wearing clothing contaminated with a skunk's musk. Flesh, leather goods, metal goods (weapons, armor, and the like) must be washed in a concentrated mixture of vinegar over period of 1d3 days. Otherwise, the stench clings for at least one week, imposing the same modifiers to random encounters and Stealth checks.
