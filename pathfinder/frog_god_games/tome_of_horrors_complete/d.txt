Control Styx (Su) Charon can control the waters of the River Styx as if using the control water spell (CL 23rd). Additionally, he can form a Huge 16 HD water elemental (known as a Styx elemental) as a standard action using this ability. A Styx elemental uses the standard 16 HD water elemental statistics with the following additional special attack: An opponent hit by a Styx elemental's slam attack must succeed on a DC 23 Will save or forget everything about its past life (treat this as a feeblemind spell). The save DC is Constitution-based. Even if the save is successful, the opponent acts as if affected by a confusion spell (CL 20th) for one day. The confusion effects can be removed using break enchantment, dispel magic, or greater magic.  Charon can have only one Styx elemental in existence at one time. A Styx elemental is CR 8.

Immortality (Ex) Charon is native to five Lower Planes (Abyss, Gehenna, Hades, Nine Hells, and Tarterus), thus when his form is destroyed on one plane, he ceases to exist there, but still exists on the other four. When destroyed on one of the aforementioned planes, it takes but a single day for him to reform and return to that plane. To be permanently destroyed, Charon must be slain on all five Lower Planes within a single day.

Disease (Ex) Daemonic Plague: Slam-injury; save Fort DC 47, onset 1 day; frequency 1/ day; effect 2d6 Con damage; cure 3 consecutive saves.  Each time the victim takes Con damage, it must succeed on a second Fort save or lose 2 points of the Con damage permanently. The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Transfixing Gaze (Su) A living creature within 30 feet that meets the Oinodaemon's gaze must succeed on a DC 46 Will save, or be held (as the hold person spell, CL 37th). An affected creature can attempt a new save each round to break the effects if it has 24 HD or more; otherwise, only the Oinodaemon can release it, or a wish or miracle can break the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. If the Oinodaemon is slain or moves more than 30 feet away from a held creature, it is automatically released. The Oinodaemon only has to remain within range to maintain this ability; he does not have to concentrate.

Staff of the Lower Planes: This 12-foot long, black wooden staff can only be wielded by the current Oinodaemon or any daemon he allows to wield it. In anyone else's hands, the staff functions as a normal quarterstaff. Upon the current Oinodaemon's death, the staff can be wielded (and it functions as detailed below) by the new Oinodaemon. The staff has the powers listed below. All powers function as the

spell of the same name (CL 25th or the wielder's caster level, whichever is higher). Save DCs are 20 + spell level.
- Doom, fear (1 charge)
- Dominate monster, geas/quest, mass charm monster, unholy aura (2 charges)
- Once per day, wish (grant another's wish) (2 charges)

The staff has an unlimited number of charges, but no more than 50 charges may be expended in a single day.

The staff's powers automatically overcome any other daemon's spell resistance. Any non-daemon that touches the staff takes 10d8 points of electricity damage per round of contact (no save) and gains two negative levels each round it touches the staff. The Fortitude save to remove a negative level has a DC of 35 and can result in actual level loss on a failed save.

Dark creepers lurk in the black places deep below the surface of the world, venturing forth at night or into neighboring societies when the urge to steal and cause mayhem grows too great to resist. Endless layers of filthy, moldering black cloth shroud these small creatures, leading some to believe that the creature inside is smaller still. Usually encountered in groups, dark creepers flee from bright light, but are quite brave in the dark.  Dark creepers stand just under 4 feet tall and weigh 80 pounds. Their flesh is pale and moist, and their eyes are milky white. Dark creepers exude a foul stench of sweat and spoiled food, owing primarily to the fact that they never take off their clothing-instead piling on new layers when the outermost one grows too ragged.  For all the mayhem and trouble a pack of dark creepers can cause, this is nothing compared to the dangers a tribe led by the taller, even more sinister Racial Hit Dice: Dark creepers begin play with 3 levels of humanoid, which provides 3d8 HD, a base attack bonus of +2, and base saves of Fort +1, Ref +3, Will +1.

All creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher within 60 feet who see the symbol must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or immediately fall into loud bickering and arguing.  Meaningful communication is impossible. If the affected creatures have different alignments, there is a 50% chance that they attack each other. Bickering lasts 5d4 rounds.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A demi-lich is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A shatter spell deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6), with no saving throw.  A power word kill spell cast by an ethereal caster deals 50 points of damage to the demi-lich if it fails a Fortitude save (DC 19 + caster's relevant ability score modifier). Note: power word kill does not normally allow a save.) A holy smite spell affects the demi-lich normally.  A dispel evil spell deals 2d6 points of damage, with no saving throw.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Rejuvenation (Su) Unless holy water is poured over the destroyed remains of a demi-lich, the creature reforms in 1d10 days with a successful level check (1d20 + demi-lich's HD) against DC 16.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Trap the Soul (Su) A demi-lich can trap the souls of up to eight living creatures per day. To use this power, it selects any target it can see within 300 feet. The target is allowed a DC 22 Fortitude saving throw. If the target makes its saving throw, it gains three negative levels (this does not count as a use of trap the soul). If the target fails its save, the soul of the target is instantly drawn from its body and trapped within one of the gems incorporated into the demi-lich's mouth. The gem gleams for 24 hours, indicating the captive soul within. The soulless body collapses in a mass of corruption and molders in a single round, reduced to dust. If left to its own devices, the demi-lich slowly devours the soul over 24 hours-at the end of that time the sou l is completely absorbed, and the victim is forever gone.  If the demi-lich is overcome before the soul is eaten, crushing the gem releases the soul, after which time it is free to seek the afterlife or be returned to its body by the use of resurrection, true resurrection, clone, or miracle. A potential victim protected by a death ward spell is not immune to trap the soul, but receives a +5 bonus on its Fortitude save and is effective against the level loss on a successful save.  The save DC is Charisma-based.

Adhesive (Ex) A tarry demodand exudes a thick tar-like substance that acts as a powerful adhesive, holding fast any creatures or items touching it. A tarry demodand has a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks due to its tarry secretions in addition to that provided by its grab ability.  A weapon that strikes a tarry demodand is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 19 Reflex save. A successful DC 19 Strength check is needed to pry it off. The save DC and check DC are Constitution-based.  Strong alcohol dissolves the adhesive. A pint of wine or a similar liquid weakens it, but the tarry demodand can still grapple normally. A tarry demodand can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 1 minute after the creature dies.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Whisper of Madness (Su) When summoned, a demon of corruption automatically establishes a mental link between itself and the one who summoned it (the host). Distance is not a factor to maintain the link, and it can span across planes and dimensions. The demon need not concentrate to maintain the link. A corruptor demon can have in existence at one time a number of links equal to its current HD. A corruptor demon can break a link it has established any time as a free action.  The link allows the demon to speak (as if by telepathy) to the host and submit subconscious thoughts and messages to him or her. Once per task requested of the corruptor demon (or once per week if no task is requested, including fractions of a week if dismissed early), as long as the link is in existence, the host must succeed on a Will save (DC 11 barizou; DC 12 azizou; DC 13 geruzou) or have his alignment shift one increment toward chaotic evil; first along the good-evil axis and then along the lawful-chaotic axis. The save DC is Charisma-based and increases by +1 each week the link is maintained. A successful save prevents the alignment shift for that week but does not break the link.  When  the  host's  alignment  completely  shifts  to chaotic evil (or if the host is chaotic evil when the link  is  first  established),  he  must  immediately succeed on a Will save (DC 15 barizou; DC 16 azizou; DC 17 geruzou) or go permanently insane (as if affected by an insanity spell, caster level 8th). The save DCs are Charisma-based and include a +4 racial bonus.  A  successful  save  negates  the  insanity for  one  month,  after  which  time  a  new save  (same  DC)  must  be  made  again. This cycle continues until the host fails  a save and goes insane or until the link between  host  and  corruptor  demon  is broken. The  link  is  blocked  by  lead  and magical  protection  (antimagic  field,  mind blank, and nondetection) and can be dispelled through magical means (dispel magic, greater restoration, and the like).  The  alignment  shift  caused  by  these  demons can only be removed after the link is broken. This requires the host to voluntarily (meaning no magical intervention such as charm person or suggestion) subject himself to a greater restoration spell. One such spell is needed for each shift along the law-chaos and good-evil axes. If the host was originally good-aligned, he must voluntarily subject himself to an atonement spell.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Scorpions (Ex) A daraka's body is swarming with thousands of tiny scorpions. Creatures attacking a daraka unarmed or with natural weapons are automatically stung for 1d6 points of damage and suffer the effects of the scorpion's poison (see Poison, above).  Alternately, a daraka can sling scorpions from its body to a range of 20 feet. This is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. A creature hit takes 1d6 points of damage from the stinging scorpions and is subjected to their poison. A grappled creature is likewise subjected to the stinging of a daraka's scorpions just as if it had attacked the daraka unarmed (see above).  A daraka has an unlimited supply of scorpions. As fast as it uses them, its body generates more.

Poison (Ex) Caizel's body courses with a virulent poison that she can intensify or suppress at will. It is not secreted through her skin (therefore her touch is not poisonous); rather it is delivered through the exchange of body fluids with another creature (kissing, consummating an encounter, etc.). If a target is not willing to be kissed, she must start a grapple to do so.  Caizel's Poison: Kiss-contact; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d8 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Touch of Ecstasy (Su) Once per round, by making a melee touch attack against a foe, Caizel can flood the creature's mind with the most pleasurable images it can conjure if it fails a DC 25 Will save. This effect stuns the creature for 1d4 rounds while its mind processes the information. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by Caizel's touch of ecstasy for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Caizel can suppress this ability at will.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:
Bonerazor: Bonerazor is a finely crafted and perfectly balanced +2 dagger. Because of its expert craftsmanship it deals 2d4 points of damage on a successful hit.  Additionally, a creature hit must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or be held (as by a hold person spell, CL 20th). The creature can make a new save each round to escape.  A creature remains held as long as Bonerazor remains embedded in its body or until it makes a successful Fortitude save. So long as Caizel is within 50 feet of it, she can command the dagger to return to her hand as a free action.

Embrace of the Uncaring Sea: Dagon's unique weapon is a +5 unholy mighty cleaving trident. On a successful critical hit, the target must make a DC 39 Fortitude save or begin to drown (see Chapter 13 of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook). This affects even creatures that can ordinarily breathe underwater or are under the effects of a water breathing spell.  The target is allowed a new saving throw each round. The drowning continues until either the target is dead, a successful save is made, or the effect is successfully dispelled (CL 30th). Even if the effect is successfully removed, another critical hit starts it once again. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +10 racial bonus when used by Dagon

The save DC is Charismabased and includes a +15 racial bonus. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell.

A metal or wooden weapon that strikes Jubilex also dissolves immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 38 Reflex save. Jubilex's acidic touch deals 38 points of damage per round to wooden or metal objects, but he must remain in contact with the object for 1 full round to deal this damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Seeping Darkness (Su) As a free action, Tsathogga can billow forth a cloud of thick, dark fog from his skin. This fog spreads to fill a 50-foot radius, 50 feet high. The darkness generated by the cloud nullifies nonmagical lights and magical lights of 5th level or lower within the area.  Furthermore, all creatures in the area gain concealment, including those that can normally see in such darkness, tough Tsathogga is able to see normally in it. Light descriptor spells of 5th level or lower (such as daylight, dancing lights, and light) are incapable of brightening the area.  This cloud remains for 10 minutes before dispersing. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the cloud in 4 rounds; a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses the cloud in 1 round. Tsathogga cannot use this ability underwater. Once the cloud disperses, Tsathogga can issue a new one if he desires.

Servants of Tsathogga

Followers of Tsathogga are the tsathar and some few evil and vile humans or
giants. He has few other worshippers, though it is rumored that an evil cult
of sahuagin worships him on the Material Plane. Devout followers of Tsathogga
are called Lords of the Gaping Maw and must sign a pact of evil with
Tsathogga. Lords of the Gaping Maw receive spells from Tsathogga and are
granted access to two of the following domains: Chaos, Destruction, Evil, and
Water.

Feed (Su) When a ghaddar slays a humanoid opponent, it can feed on the corpse, devouring both flesh and life force, as a full-round action.

If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic.  A ghaddar advances in Hit Dice by consuming corpses in this fashion. For every three suitable corpses a ghaddar devours, it gains 1 Hit Die, and its Strength, Constitution, and natural armor increase by +1. Its attack bonus and saves improve as normal for an outsider of its Hit Dice, and it gains skill points, feats, and ability score improvements normally.

Fiery Body (Ex) The oil coating a hellstoker's body is highly flammable. As such, a hellstoker hit with a fire effect bursts into flames. This deals no damage to the hellstoker, and deals 1d6 points of fire damage to any creature touching or grappling the hellstoker. The fire burns for 10 rounds before extinguishing. This does not damage the hellstoker's oily hide; therefore, it still retains its racial bonus to Escape Artist checks (see oily hide below), and it can be caught on fire again.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Oily Hide (Ex) Hellstokers do not secrete oil naturally, but their constant contact with it leaves them coated with a thick layer of the substance at all times. This grants hellstokers a +10 racial bonus to Escape Artist checks (included in the statistics block). The oil cannot be washed off or removed.  Additionally, if a hellstoker is hit with a fire effect, it bursts into flames. See the hellstoker's fiery body above for details.

succeed on a DC 40 Fortitude save or be annihilated instantly-not even a trace
of dust is left behind. No form of mortal magic can restore life to a creature
annihilated by this ray. Lucifer or a deity can restore the annihilated
creature to life using magic.

Rod of Rulership: The rod has all of the abilities and powers of a rod of
rulership.

Trap the Soul: Once per round, and no more than three times per day, the rod
can fire a ray of hellish-red energy to a range of 60 feet that functions as a
trap the soul spell (CL 20th). A target can make a DC 40 Will save to resist
the effects. If failed, the victim's soul vanishes into Lucifer's rod. Up to
10 such souls can be held in the rod at one time. A trapped soul may be freed
by grasping the rod and speaking a command word.

Any non-devil that touches the rod takes 10d8 points of electricity damage per
round of contact (no save) and gains two negative levels each round it touches
the rod. The Fortitude save to remove a negative level has a DC of 40 and can
result in actual level loss on a failed save. The negative levels cannot be
overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the rod is wielded.
Any goodaligned creature that touches the rod takes 3d6 points of Constitution
drain each round it touches the rod (DC 40 Fortitude save for half).

Hell's Redoubt: Hell's Redoubt is Lucifer's Large suit of +5 heavy
fortification banded mail that has no armor check penalty, speed penalty, and
no chance for arcane spell failure. It was personally crafted for him the
hands of Cheshimiboth, Armorer of the Nine Hells, just prior to the Great
Uprising. To reward this unique devil's genius for crafting, Lucifer had him
murdered in the first moments of the Uprising to prevent him from ever
revealing any vulnerability in the armor he fashioned or ever again crafting
its equal. In addition to its fortification qualities, three times per day,
Lucifer can cause the fires of Hell to spring forth in a 30-foot radius spread
around him (the spread remains stationary once called forth). These fires last
for 3 rounds and deal 10d6 points of fire damage per round (DC 40 Reflex save
for half) and ignore all fire resistance and fire immunity. Only the wearer of
the armor is immune to their effects. Those slain by these fires are
completely destroyed (including their equipment) and cannot be returned to
life through anything short of divine intervention.  Hell's Redoubt functions
as +1 banded mail and bestows five negative levels for as long as it is worn
if worn by anyone other than Lucifer unless the wearer defeats Asmodeus and
gains the Throne of Hell. At that point it resumes its ordinary function.
Anyone wearing the armor is filled with the overwhelming urge to attempt to do
that very thing no matter the cost. The negative levels disappear if the armor
is removed.


Servants of Lucifer

Followers of Lucifer are far and wide and consist of evil humanoids; usually clerics, necromancers, sorcerers, and wizards. Devout followers of Lucifer are called Dark Cardinals and must sign a pact of evil with Lucifer. Dark Cardinals can receive spells from Lucifer and are granted access to two of the following domains: Evil, Law, Strength, and War.

A DC 37 Fortitude save halves the fire damage but does not negate the penalties. 2nd-round: The victim's blood reaches searing temperatures and begins to burn away muscle and flesh; the circumstance penalty increases to -4. Smoke rises from the victim's flesh. The victim takes 6d6 points of fire damage this round. A DC 37 Fortitude save halves the fire damage but does not negate the penalties.  3rd-round: The victim's blood erupts into an inferno and explodes from its body dealing 12d6 points of fire damage; the victim is stunned for 3 rounds. A DC 37 Fortitude save halves the fire damage but the victim is still stunned.  A successful Will save renders a creature immune to Xaphan's gaze for one day.

Navigate (Ex) A captain merely has to whisper into the ear of the dragon-head and make a Profession (sailor) check (DC 15) to get the dragonship to understand its course. A dragonship never gets lost on an ocean voyage, and has a 50% chance of automatically being aware of any safe coastline, seaside towns and villages, and hidden ocean dangers such as reefs and sandbars (it only knows of such dangers if they are in the volume of sea charts used in its creation).

Winds (Su) At will, a dragonship can cause winds to fill its sails. This operates as the control winds spell (caster level 10th) with the restriction that it can only increase the wind's force for the purposes of propulsion. The winds are generated from a point beyond and slightly above the dragonship's stern. A dragonship cannot use these winds to attack; their sole purpose is propulsion.

Control Ship (Su) A draug has full control over its vessel (wind notwithstanding) so long as it remains at the wheel or within 20 feet of the helmsman. Should it leave the area, its ship meanders in a random direction until the draug regains control. A draug also imbues its ship with special abilities (see Draug Ships, below).


Draug Ships
When a ship sinks beneath the waves, it and its entire crew may return as ghostly wanderers, especially if the captain and crew had a less than scrupulous profession (as pirates, for example). A sunken ship of this nature may undergo a transformation from the negative energy and evil surrounding it.  When this happens, the ship rises from the deep, piloted by a draug and manned by skeletons, brine zombies, zombies, and lacedons. The ship appears as it did at the time of its demise. The sails are tattered and the decks covered with seaweed. When a draug is at the helm, the "ghost ship" gains the following powers:

It is not affected by wind of any type (though the draug can still use the wind to maneuver and sail the ship) and can even sail against gale-force winds. Strong waves may toss the ship about, but will not capsize it as a result.
