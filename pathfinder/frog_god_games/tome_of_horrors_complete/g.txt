AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Create Gallows Tree Zombie (Su) When a creature dies within 15 feet of a gallows tree, it uses a sharpened tendril to slice open the creature's abdomen, thereby spilling the corpse's innards on the ground. The organs and fluids are then absorbed by the tree's roots.  Corpses of a size other than Medium or Large are simply left to rot. Medium or Large corpses are filled with a greenish pollen fired from one of the tree's branches. The abdominal wound heals over the next 1d4 days, at which time the slain creature rises as a gallows tree zombie connected by a tether-vine to the gallows tree that created it. Gallows tree zombies possess none of their former abilities.

Animate Boulders (Sp) A geon can animate rocks within 180 feet at will, controlling up to two rocks at a time. Boulders move at a speed of 10 feet and fight as a geon in all respects.  Animated boulders lose their ability to move if the geon that animated them is incapacitated or moves out of range. The ability is otherwise similar to liveoak (caster level 15th), but affects rocks rather than trees. Animated boulders have the same vulnerability to cold that a geon has.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Limited Gaseous Form (Ex) Because it has solid body parts that constantly float and swirl within it, a cinder ghoul has a limited version of the gaseous form ability. Although other gaseous creatures can issue under the crack of a door, a cinder ghoul cannot. A cinder ghoul can, however, make slam attacks, retains its natural armor bonus, and all supernatural attacks. Spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities affect them normally. A cinder ghoul cannot enter water or other liquid. It is not ethereal or incorporeal, and is affected by winds or other forms of moving air to the extent that the wind pushes them in the direction the wind is moving.  However, even the strongest wind can't disperse or damage a cinder ghoul. Because it contains burning embers and small bits of perpetually smoldering flesh, a cinder ghoul cannot hide and gets no bonuses to Stealth checks in an area of mist, smoke, or other gas.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Smoke Inhalation (Su) As a standard action, a cinder ghoul can attempt to force some of its smoky form into the lungs of a living opponent. To initiate this attack it must move into its target's space. The target must then make a successful DC 18 Fortitude save or inhale part of the creature. Smoke inside the victim's lungs burns the surrounding tissues and organs, dealing 1d2 points of Constitution damage each round. The affected creature can attempt another Fortitude save each round to cough out the burning residue. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Animate Dust (Su) Once per day, a dust ghoul can cause 1d4 ghostly humanoid-shaped creatures to materialize from an area of dust and earth within 100 feet. The dust ghoul can control and direct these creatures as long as it is "alive" and within 100 feet.  The dust creatures have a speed of 10 feet and each has only one attack; a grapple. Each has a CMB equal to 1/2 dust ghoul's HD + its Strength modifier (+12 CMB for the standard dust ghoul).  A dust creature holds but does not harm creatures it grapples. The dust humanoids are immune to all attacks and spells, except water-based spells and effects. A gallon of water instantly destroys a dust humanoid. If the dust ghoul moves more than 100 feet away from a dust creature, that dust creature collapses into a pile of harmless dust. If the dust ghoul is destroyed, all dust creatures it animated collapse.

The sand giant can order the arm to attack a target as a move action. Once given a target, the arm automatically attacks that target on the giant's turn. The arm remains for a number of rounds equal to the sand giant's Hit Dice (19 rounds for a typical sand giant). A sand giant does not need to concentrate to maintain the arm and can direct it to attack a new target or adapt a new tactic as a free action.  The arm's base attack bonus is equal to that of the giant that created it, and it deals slam damage equal to the slam attack for a creature of its size (Huge). Any creature struck must succeed on a DC 29 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based, using the HD of the sand giant and the Strength of the fist of sand.  The arm has an AC of 20 (+12 natural, -2 size) and has hit points equal to three times the Constitution score of the sand giant that created it. It has a Strength score of 30.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Weakness Pheromone (Ex) After the first round of combat, a gloomwing can emit a scent in a 30-foot radius as a free action that deals 1d2 points of Strength damage to any living, non-vermin creature (except gloomwings) in the area. An affected creature can make a successful DC 13 Fortitude save each round it remains in the area to negate the effects.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Luck/Unluck (Su) When a golden cat selects an "owner" it grants that creature good fortune. Three times per day, so long as the golden cat is within 40 feet, the owner can reroll one die roll and take the most favorable result. Only one die can be rerolled each round. This ability is a power of the cat, not the owner, though the owner can simply telepathically communicate its desire to the cat. A golden cat cannot be forced to activate this ability if it does not wish to do so (unless magically compelled). Each time the golden cat activates this ability and the owner rerolls a die, all other creatures (including the owner's allies) within 40 feet of the golden cat must reroll one die roll and take the least favorable result each time.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Blood Consumption (Su) Each time a blood golem hits a living opponent with a slam attack, it gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt. These bonus hit points are added to the blood golem's total even if the addition takes it above its current maximum hit points. A blood golem cannot gain more hit points than the maximum hit points allowed by its HD (not including any bonus hit points it may have from its Con score). For example, a 7-HD blood golem cannot gain more than 56 hit points.  If a blood golem successfully hits an opponent with both of its slam attacks in a single round, that opponent suffers catastrophic blood expulsion, taking 2d4 points of Constitution damage (DC 15 Fortitude save for half). A blood golem gains 5 hit points per point of Constitution damage it deals. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.  When a blood golem reaches its maximum hit points for its Hit Dice, it divides (see cell division, below).

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Cell Division (Ex) When a blood golem absorbs enough blood to raise its hit points to the maximum for its HD, it splits into two identical blood golems, each with half the original's hit points. For example, a 7-HD blood golem that reaches 56 hit points splits into two 7-HD blood golems with 28 hit points each.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Vulnerability to Magic (Ex) A blood golem is slowed (as the spell) for 1d4 rounds by any cold-based attacks or effects. A purify food and water spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to a blood golem. A blood golem can attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + caster's ability score modifier) to reduce the damage by half.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Camouflage (Ex) While flattened, a flagstone golem is nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding floor. It takes a DC 25 Perception check to notice a flattened flagstone golem for what it is. Dwarves get a +2 bonus on Perception checks to notice a flattened flagstone golem.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Energy Absorption (Su) Any energy-based (acid, fire, cold, electricity, sonic) attack that directly targets a flagstone golem is absorbed into its body dealing no damage to the golem. A flagstone golem can use the absorbed energy to repair itself, healing 1 hit point for every 3 points of damage the attack would have otherwise dealt. Or it can release the energy in a 30-foot cone that deals 3d8 points of energy damage (of whatever type was absorbed) to all within the area. An affected opponent can attempt a DC 14 Reflex save to reduce the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based. The flagstone golem can store the energy before releasing it as an energy blast for a number of rounds equal to half its Hit Dice (four rounds for the standard flagstone golem).

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Flatten (Ex) As a standard action, once per round, a flagstone golem can flatten its form to become (or appear to become) a section of floor, road, or any other stone surface. While flattened it cannot move or attack and its damage reduction increases to 20/adamantine. A flagstone golem can reform into its humanoid shape as a standard action.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A flagstone golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance.  In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A transmute rock to mud spell slows it (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw.  A transmute mud to rock spell heals all its lost hit points.

Furnace-Interior (Ex) A furnace golem can try to shove a grabbed opponent up to two sizes smaller than itself into its interior by making a successful grapple check.  An opponent thrown into the furnace golem's interior is trapped as a metal grating closes over the opening in the same round. A trapped creature automatically takes 2d6 points of fire damage each round. Escaping the creature's interior requires a successful Strength check (DC 30) to bend the bars. Alternately a trapped creature can escape by dealing at least 25 points of damage to the bars (AC 22). Note, the golem's damage reduction applies to all attacks against the bars.  A Huge furnace golem's interior can hold 2 Medium, 8 Small, or 16 Tiny or smaller creatures.

Immunity to Magic (Ex) A furnace golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance.  In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature as noted below.  A magical attack that bypasses its cold resistance slows a furnace golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw.  A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the furnace golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of damage would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.

Engulf (Ex) A gelatinous golem can try to wrap an opponent up to one size smaller than itself in its body as a standard action. The gelatinous golem attempts a grapple that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple the gelatinous golem establishes a hold. Attacks that hit an engulfing gelatinous golem deal half their damage to the golem and half to the engulfed victim.  An engulfed opponent is subjected to the gelatinous golem's paralysis and acid each round it remains trapped. A trapped opponent can do nothing other than attempt to escape. Further, an engulfed foe must hold its breath or begin drowning (see the Core Rulebook for the drowning rules).  While engulfing an opponent, a gelatinous golem is not considered grappled and can move and attack normally.

Animated Host (Su) Once a victim trapped within an iron maiden has died, it reanimates as a zombie in the next round (as if by an animate dead spell). It cannot escape, however, and serves only to fuel the iron maiden and provide it with skills and abilities. While it is trapped, the zombie cannot be attacked, damaged, turned, rebuked, or commanded, and it doesn't suffer any damage from the bladed lid. If the lid of the golem is somehow forced open, the zombie has the normal abilities of a Medium zombie (as detailed in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary). The victim of an iron maiden golem must be alive when it is placed inside and the lid is closed or the golem's animate host ability fails.

Bladed Lid (Ex) A living creature inside an iron maiden when the lid is closed is pierced by twenty dagger-like blades, dealing a total of 50 points of piercing damage each round. The lid automatically seals with an arcane lock spell with a caster level equal to that of the iron maiden golem's creator (14th level usually). The lid can be forced open with a successful Strength check (DC 34) or by casting dispel magic. The knock spell has no effect on the lid. The check DC is Strength-based and includes a +10 bonus from the arcane lock spell.  Because of the shape of the iron maiden, only a Medium humanoid can be sealed inside.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Steal Essence (Su) An iron maiden golem that has created a host using its animate host ability (see above) gains 10 temporary hit points, uses its own base attack bonus or the host's (whichever is higher), and can make normal use of the victim's skills, feats, and non-magical class abilities.  The golem must substitute its own ability scores when determining its total skill bonuses; therefore it cannot use skills requiring Constitution or Intelligence, and since it cannot speak, many Charisma skills are severely limited. Likewise, the iron maiden golem must meet the requirements for any feat in order to make use of that feat (thus feats such as Dodge and Combat Expertise are unavailable to the golem). An iron maiden cannot use any divine spells or divinely granted special abilities, since the host within is no longer able to receive such abilities from her deity. An iron maiden likewise cannot use any arcane spells as its inherent magic immunity disrupts any attempt to do so.

The golem is anodized during the creation process by submerging it in a solution of acid. During this time, the creator must cast lightning or some other electricity-based effect into the solution. This deals no damage to the golem. After four hours, the magnesium golem is removed from the solution.

Witch-Doll Link (Su) A witch-doll golem can establish an invisible link between itself and its programmed target by making a successful melee attack against its programmed target. If successful, the opponent can attempt a DC 19 Fortitude save to resist the link. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. A witch-doll link is broken if the witch-doll golem is destroyed, the target dies, or the witch-doll golem is programmed with a new target. A witch-doll golem cannot establish this link with any other creature other than its programmed target.

In addition, certain spells function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A confusion spell slows it (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw.  A mending spell heals 2d6 hit points.

Resist Magic (Ex) A witch-doll golem gains a +4 bonus on all saving throws against any spell or spell-like ability or effect cast by its programmed target (provided the effect gets past its immunity to magic). The witch-doll does not have to be linked to its target to gain this bonus.

GRAYMALKINS
DESC:Graymalkins are magical creatures that resemble ordinary cats. To the casual observer, a graymalkin appear  to be nothing more than a raggedy-looking cat with nothing unusual about it. This disguise aids the graymalkin
in its travels, allowing it to move unmolested among living creatures.

Graymalkins always dwell near populated areas, preferring cities to towns, towns to villages, and so on. They often choose an owner (a living creature they deem gullible and easily manipulated) and convince that creature to take them home with them (by using their fascination ability). Once inside their owner's house, a graymalkin uses its special abilities to kill its owner and any other family members. Such attacks usually occur at night (in the case of the slinker) or over a period of time (in the case of the tether).

Graymalkins are often found serving as the familiar to an evil spellcaster or hag. They prefer females to males when serving as a familiar and very rarely do they ever use their special abilities against their true owner. (Some tales say that when a graymalkin is serving as a familiar, its master is actually immune to its special abilities.)

Graymalkins avoid  direct  confrontations with  opponents,  preferring to attack helpless or otherwise unobservant foes. If forced into battle, a graymalkin seeks escape as quick as possible.

All graymalkins possess the following ability.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Fascination (Su): Once per round as a standard action, a graymalkin can attempt to fascinate a single opponent. The target can make a successful Will save to resist the attempt. On a successful save, that target is immune to the fascination ability of that graymalkin for 24 hours.  If the save fails, the target becomes fascinated with the graymalkin and "adopts" it as a pet, becoming its new owner. The owner clings to the cat and always keeps it close by, feeling withdrawn and lethargic if the graymalkin is farther away. A fascinated target resists any urges or suggestions to rid itself of its new found friend, even to the point of becoming combative and enraged. This fascination lasts until the graymalkin is killed, the owner dies, or the graymalkin remains more than 20 feet away from its owner for at least 24 hours. The effect is otherwise similar to a charm person spell (caster level equals the graymalkin's HD). A graymalkin can only ever have one owner at a single time. If it uses its fascination ability against another creature, that target becomes its new owner on a failed save. All fascination effects on its previous owner are immediately dispelled. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Attach (Ex) When a gryph hits with its legs, its talons latch tightly onto the target, anchoring it in place. An attached gryph is effectively grappling its prey. The gryph loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 11, but holds on with great tenacity and gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls with its bite. Alternatively, an attached gryph can attempt to implant eggs in the target. An attached gryph has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached gryph can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself-if its prey manages to win a grapple check or Escape Artist check against it, the gryph is removed.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Implant Eggs (Ex) Once per day, a gryph can implant eggs into a helpless target or a target that it is currently attached to as a full-round action by extending an ovipositor from its abdomen and penetrating the victim's flesh by making a successful +4 melee attack. On a hit, the ovipositor inflicts 1 damage and implants 1d4 eggs into the victim's body. As long as a victim has gryph eggs implanted in his body, he is sickened as the eggs draw nutrients from his blood and flesh. The eggs grow swiftly, hatching in a mere 1d4 minutes into ravenous baby gryphs that immediately burrow out of the victim's body. This inflicts 2 points of Constitution damage per baby gryph, after which the hatchlings immediately take wing and fly away.  Treat a gryph hatchling as a bat if statistics are needed.  Gryph eggs can be cut out of a victim's body with a successful DC 20 Heal check made as a full-round action that inflicts 1 point of damage per attempt. Although immunity to disease offers no special protection against gryph egg implantation, remove disease or heal immediately destroys any implanted gryph eggs.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Blood Drain (Ex) A gutslug that grapples a foe drains blood. This deals 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the grapple is maintained. Once a gutslug has drained 8 points, it detaches and flies or slithers away to digest its meal.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Vulnerabilities (Ex) Gutslugs are vulnerable to salt. A pint of salt deals 1d4 points of damage to a gutslug for 1d2 rounds and causes it to lose its racial bonus to grapple checks. A pint of alcohol poured or thrown on a gutslug deals no damage but causes it to lose its racial bonus to grapple checks.
