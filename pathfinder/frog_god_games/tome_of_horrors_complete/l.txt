Soul Capture (Su): Any living creature reduced to below 0 hit points while within 60 feet of a lantern goat must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or have its soul drawn into the lantern goat's lantern. The DC increases by +1 for every hit point the character is below 0 (e.g., a character at -3 hit points must save at DC 20). Once captured, the lantern goat slowly digests the creature's soul over a period of 1 hour, using it to fuel its dark energies. A creature slain in this manner can only be returned to life by a resurrection, true resurrection, wish, or miracle. Raise dead has no effect on such a slain creature. If the lantern goat is slain and the lantern destroyed, the soul is released back to the body if still living. The lantern cannot be destroyed or removed until the lantern goat is destroyed. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Those who fail the save are also nauseated for 1d6 rounds, while those who succeed are merely sickened for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Spell Leech (Su) Whenever a spellcaster within 50 feet of a lich shade casts a spell, the spellcaster must make a DC 20 Will save or the spell is lost, as if it were counterspelled. The lost spell's energy is transferred to the lich shade, who can use the magical energy in one of the following three ways. A lich shade can only store the energy of one spell at a time.  Cast: A lich shade can cast the spell on his turn at caster level 11th. When casting spells in this manner, he ignores the spell's material component requirements, but not its focus requirements.  Eldritch Bolt: A lich shade can release the spell as an eldritch bolt of pure magic energy as a standard action (range 50 ft., ranged touch +12, 1d6 damage per 2 levels of the spell used to create it).  Healing: A lich shade can absorb the spell's energy to heal hit points equal to the spell's level ×4. Hit points in excess of his maximum are instead gained as temporary hit points.  These temporary hit points last for 1 hour before fading.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:

The save DC is Strength-based.  An engulfed creature can be freed by killing the livestone or by casting stone to flesh on the livestone. This deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the livestone and automatically ejects an engulfed victim.

Solidify (Ex) A livestone can solidify all or part of itself into a material with the hardness and consistency of solid rock. A solidified part of a livestone has a hardness of 8 and a break DC of 50. A livestone can effect the solidification as a free action. An opponent attacking a livestone must succeed on a DC 19 Reflex save each time his attack hits. If the save is failed, the livestone actually solidifies the portion of its body at the instant it was hit, thus applying its hardness rating of 8 to any damage it takes. A livestone cannot attack if its entire form is solidified. The save DC is Strength-based.

An engulfed creature is trapped in the living lake’s body, where the ooze inflicts automatic slam damage each round. In addition, an engulfed foe has no air to breathe and must hold its breath or risk drowning (see the Pathfinder Core Rulebook for rules on drowning).

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Blend with Stone (Su) A lythic can use its Stealth skill even when being observed. As long as it's within 10 feet of some sort of stone, a lythic can hide itself from view in the open without anything to actually hide behind.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Earth Glide (Su) A lythic can glide through stone, dirt or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing lythic flings the lythic back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Fury of the Earth (Su) Anytime a lythic suffers more than 50% of its normal hit points in damage in a single encounter, it flies into a berserker-like rage. This grants the lythic a bonus to its damage rolls equal to one-half its Hit Dice for the remainder of the encounter. It cannot end this fury voluntarily but continues until all opponents are defeated or have fled.
