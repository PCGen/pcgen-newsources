Bedlam

AAA	KEY:Bedlam ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BedlamRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Chaos Burst (Su) Once per round as a standard action, a bedlam can release a burst of crackling gray energy in a 20-foot radius around itself. Lawful creatures caught in the area take 5d8 points of damage and are staggered for 1d6 rounds. Non-lawful and non-chaotic creatures take 3d8 points of damage, but are not staggered. A successful DC 18 Will save halves the damage and negates the staggered effect. Chaotic-aligned creatures are immune to this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:Bedlam ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BedlamRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Chaotic Resonance (Su) A bedlam emanates an aura of pure chaos; an invisible and ever-changing ring of chaotic energy. This aura disrupts spells and magic items (except those of a chaotic nature) used within 20 feet of the bedlam.  Spellcasters in the area must make a successful DC 18 caster level check each time they attempt to cast a spell. If the check fails, the spell fizzles away just as if it had been cast. Any magic item used within this area must make a successful DC 18 Fortitude save or lose its magical properties for that round.  A new save must be made each round the item remains within the area. These DCs are Constitution-based. Spells with the chaotic descriptor that are cast within this area function as if they were empowered (as by the Empower Spell feat). Chaotically-aligned weapons (anarchic weapons) deal an additional +1d6 points of chaotic damage while in this aura (e.g., an anarchic weapon deals 3d6 total points of chaotic damage while in this aura). Lawful-aligned weapons are unaffected by this aura and also bypass the bedlam's damage reduction.

AAA	KEY:Bedlam ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BedlamRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:

The save DC is Constitution-based. A creature that fails its save is partially blinded and overcome with fits of sneezing. Both effects last 1d6+2 rounds. An affected creature takes a -1 penalty to AC, loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any), moves at half speed, and takes a -2 penalty on Perception checks and on Strengthand Dexterity-based skills and checks. All checks relying on vision (such as reading and Perception) have a 50% chance of failing. All opponents are considered to have concealment (20% miss chance) relative to the blinded character.

AAA	KEY:Belabra ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BelabraRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

Blood Consumption (Su) Each time a blood golem hits a living opponent with a slam attack, it gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt. These bonus hit points are added to the blood golem's total even if the addition takes it above its current maximum hit points. A blood golem cannot gain more hit points than the maximum hit points allowed by its HD (not including any bonus hit points it may have from its Con score). For example, a 7-HD blood golem cannot gain more than 56 hit points.  If a blood golem successfully hits an opponent with both of its slam attacks in a single round, that opponent suffers catastrophic blood expulsion, taking 2d4 points of Constitution damage (DC 15 Fortitude save for half). A blood golem gains 5 hit points per point of Constitution damage it deals. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.  When a blood golem reaches its maximum hit points for its Hit Dice, it divides (see cell division, below).

AAA	KEY:BloodGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BloodGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Cell Division (Ex) When a blood golem absorbs enough blood to raise its hit points to the maximum for its HD, it splits into two identical blood golems, each with half the original's hit points. For example, a 7-HD blood golem that reaches 56 hit points splits into two 7-HD blood golems with 28 hit points each.

AAA	KEY:BloodGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BloodGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

This is a standard action that deals 1d2 points of Constitution damage each round.  At Constitution 0, the host dies and the blood pudding feeds on the corpse. When sated, the pudding exits, and to onlookers it appears as if the slain creature is bleeding profusely.

AAA	KEY:BloodPudding ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BloodPuddingRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Infuse (Ex) A blood pudding that makes a successful grapple check can forcibly merge its form with that of a living creature. If it succeeds, the blood pudding's form disappears as it soaks through skin, wounds, and any other opening in the host's body. This special attack deals no damage but allows the blood pudding to use its disgorge special attack (see above).  A creature infused with a blood pudding can try to forcibly eject the creature once per round as a standard action (coughing it up, vomiting, and so on). This requires a successful DC 17 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based.  A creature can be affected by the pudding's infuse attack again, but gains a +2 conditional bonus on its Fortitude save. This bonus lasts for one day and is effective against the infuse attack of that blood pudding only.

AAA	KEY:BloodPudding ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BloodPuddingRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Racial Vulnerabilities (Ex) Drinking alcohol weakens an infused pudding and reduces the Constitution damage sustained from its disgorge attack by one-half for the next 1d4+1 rounds.  Consuming pure vinegar causes an infused blood pudding to eject itself from the host in the same round the vinegar is consumed. A creature drinking pure vinegar must make a successful DC 12 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d3 rounds. A blood pudding will not use its infuse attack against that host for one day.  A blood pudding hit with a cold effect or attack is slowed for 3 rounds (as the slow spell) and loses its racial bonus to grapple checks for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level.

AAA	KEY:BloodPudding ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BloodPuddingRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

AAA	KEY:BloodReaverDevil ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BloodReaverDevilRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Stun (Su) Whenever a blood reaver hits with a dire flail attack, the opponent must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based. This ability is a function of the blood reaver, not the dire flail.

A victim that becomes a host returns to the plant whenever it calls. It is normally used by the bloodsuckle for feeding purposes, but if the plant comes under attack may be summoned for defense. A host with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher that is commanded to act in a manner inconsistent with its alignment (such as attacking allies) is allowed another Will save with a +4 bonus to break the bloodsuckle's control.

Seed (Ex) Once per month, a bloodsuckle can generate a walnut-sized seed that it implants in a host's body. The host wanders off and 1d4 days later, the seed breaks open growing a new bloodsuckle inside the host. Each day a host remains implanted with this seed, it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage.

AAA	KEY:BogMummy ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BogMummyRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Bog Rot (Su) Supernatural disease-slam; save Fort DC 16; onset 1 day; frequency 1 day; effect 1d6 Str, Dex, Con, or Cha (determine randomly using 1d4); cure -. Creatures afflicted with bog rot do not heal naturally and gain only one-half benefit from magical healing until the disease is cured. Unlike normal diseases, bog rot continues until the victim reaches Constitution 0 (and dies) or receives a remove disease spell or similar magic. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:BogMummy ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BogMummyRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Create Spawn (Su) Any humanoid that dies from bog rot becomes a bog mummy in 1d4 days unless a remove disease is cast (within one day after death) or the creature is brought back to life (raise dead is ineffective, but resurrection or true resurrection works). Spawn are under the command of the bog mummy that created them and remain enslaved until their death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

AAA	KEY:BogMummy ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BogMummyRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:

Bogeyman

AAA	KEY:Bogeyman ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BogeymanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Bump in the Night (Su) A bogeyman can create a phantasmagoric image in the mind of a single creature within 200 feet. Such images cause the victim to see and hear things that are not really there or to see and hear things differently than they actually are. Things such as following footsteps, bumps and thumps from an unknown source, a gnarled tree with outstretched limbs scratching on a window or reaching for someone, the idea that someone or something is lurking around the corner, in the closet, or under the bed, and so on. A creature affected by the images takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage if it fails a DC 19 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus from the bogeyman's Ability Focus feat. The bogeyman can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. A creature who drops to Wisdom 0 is affected as if by an insanity spell (caster level 8th) until at least 1 point of Wisdom is restored.

AAA	KEY:Bogeyman ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BogeymanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Frighten (Su) A living creature within 60 feet that views a bogeyman must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or stand frozen in fear for 1d6+2 rounds. Such a creature is not helpless, but cannot take any action. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same bogeyman's frighten ability for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:Bogeyman ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BogeymanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Shadow Shift (Su) A bogeyman has the ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a dimension door spell. The limitation is that the magical transport must begin and end in an area with at least some shadow. A bogeyman can shift up to a total of 80 feet each day in this way; this may be a single jump of 80 feet or multiple jumps of 10 feet each. This amount can be split among many jumps, but each one, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot increment.

Boggart

AAA	KEY:Boggart ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoggartRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Change Shape (Su) A boggart's natural form is that of a small humanoid (resembling a young gnome, halfling, or goblin). It has one other form: that of a small, immature will-o'-wisp. In humanoid form, a boggart assumes the same appearance and traits of its form, much as a lycanthrope would. In humanoid form, a boggart retains all of its special attacks and special qualities. The second form is that of a will-o- 'wisp. In this form, a boggart is nearly indistinguishable from a normal willo'-wisp, but a DC 18 Knowledge (dungeoneering) or Perception check reveals that the boggart is in fact smaller and brighter. A boggart can assume either form as a standard action, though it cannot maintain either one for longer than 1 minute (10 rounds). A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the boggart revert to its true natural form when slain. A true seeing spell reveals the boggart's natural form if it is in will-o'-wisp form.

AAA	KEY:Boggart ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoggartRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Confusion (Su) Once per day, as a full-round action, a boggart can unleash a screech that confuses all those hearing it within 30 ft. of the boggart. The confusion lasts for 6 rounds. An affected creature can make a DC 15 Will save to negate the effects. Each additional boggart within 10 feet that joins the screeching increases the save DC by +1. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:Boggart ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoggartRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Detect Thoughts (Su) A boggart can continuously detect thoughts as the spell (caster level 8th). It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.

AAA	KEY:Boggart ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoggartRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Electricity (Su) A boggart delivers 2d6 points of electricity damage with a successful slam attack (DC 15 Fortitude for half). The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:Boggart ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoggartRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Electrical Discharge (Su) Once every other round as a standard action, a boggart can discharge a bolt of electricity in a 10-foot line. The bolt deals 2d6 points of electricity damage (DC 15 Reflex save for half). The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:Boggart ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoggartRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Feed (Su) When a boggart slays a humanoid opponent, it can feed on the corpse, devouring both flesh and life force, as a full-round action. Feeding destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic. A boggart advances in Hit Dice by consuming corpses in this fashion. For every three suitable corpses a boggart devours, it gains 1 Hit Die, and its Strength, Constitution, and natural armor increase by +1. Its attack bonus and saves improve as normal for an aberration of its Hit Dice, and it gains skill ranks, feats, and ability score improvements normally. The boggart only advances by consuming the corpses of creatures whose Hit Dice or levels are equal to or greater than its own current total. A boggart that reaches 9 Hit Dice through feeding immediately becomes a will-o'-wisp upon completion of the act.

AAA	KEY:Boggart ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoggartRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

Animate Bones (Su) Once per day, a bone cobbler can animate up to 5 skeletal statues within 30 feet as a standard action. These creatures fight as skeletons (see Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary), though their forms and structures do not necessarily have to resemble humanoids (or anything remotely humanoid). This ability otherwise functions similar to an animate dead spell (caster level 7th).

AAA	KEY:BoneCobbler ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoneCobblerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Bonestripping (Ex) A bone cobbler can rapidly strip all the flesh from a Medium creature in 3 minutes using its claws and hammers. For each size category larger than Medium a corpse is, add 1 minute to the time it takes the bone cobbler to strip the corpse. For each size category smaller than Medium a corpse is, reduce the time by 1 minute (to a minimum of 1 minute). Once stripped, the bone cobbler devours the flesh and collects the victim's bones to use in its "sculptures". A creature slain in this manner can only be brought back to life by a miracle, wish, or true resurrection spell.

AAA	KEY:BoneCobbler ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoneCobblerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

AAA	KEY:BrassMan ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BrassManRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A brass man is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows a brass man (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw.  A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the brass man and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the brass man to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A brass man gets no saving throw against fire effects.

AAA	KEY:BrassMan ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BrassManRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

Affected creatures that succeed on a DC 20 Will save are unaffected and immune to the sardonic laugh of that bronze giant for 24 hours. On a failed save, that creature is shaken for as long as it remains within 100 feet of the bronze giant and for 2d4 rounds thereafter. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:BrownPudding ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BrownPuddingRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Acid (Ex) A brown pudding secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material quickly, but does not affect metal or stone. Any melee hit or constriction attack deals acid damage, and the opponent's clothing and armor (nonmetal only) take the same amount of damage unless they succeed on DC 21 Reflex saves. A wooden weapon that strikes a brown pudding takes 2d6 acid damage unless it succeeds on a DC 21 Reflex save. If a brown pudding remains in contact with a wooden object for 1 full round, it inflicts 21 points of damage (no save) to the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:BrownPudding ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BrownPuddingRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

AAA	KEY:BrownPudding ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BrownPuddingRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Suction (Ex) The brown pudding can create powerful suction against any surfaces as it climbs, allowing it to cling to inverted surfaces with ease. A brown pudding can establish or release suction as a swift action, and as long as it is using suction, it moves at half speed. Because of the suction, a brown pudding's CMD score gets a +10 circumstance bonus to resist bull rush, awesome blows, and other attacks and effects that attempt to physically move it from its location.

Memory Loss (Su) An opponent hit by a brume's claw attack must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or forget everything that has happened in the last 1d6 hours (treat this as a modify memory spell). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Even if the save is successful, the opponent acts as if affected by a confusion spell (caster level 13th) for 2d4 hours. The confusion effects can be removed using break enchantment, dispel magic, or greater magic.

AAA	KEY:Brume ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BrumeRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Insubstantial Form (Ex) A brume's insubstantial form gives it immunity to poison and critical hits. It cannot run, wear armor, or enter water or other liquids. It can pass through holes and small openings-even cracks. It can also occupy spaces occupied by its enemies. (This ability is similar to a gaseous form spell-note the brume is not subject to wind effects like the gaseous form spell allows.) Any piercing or slashing attack against a brume has a 20% miss chance.  Bludgeoning attacks deal damage normally.

Cat Lord

AAA	KEY:CatLord ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CatLordRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Change Shape (Su) The Cat Lord can assume the shape of a human as a standard action. In human form, the Cat Lord cannot use his natural weapons or his howl, pounce, spit, or rake special attacks but can wield weapons and wear armor. Unlike the normal change shape ability, the Cat Lord retains his movement modes (and speeds) in human form.

AAA	KEY:CatLord ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CatLordRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Feline Passivism (Ex) Felines (including dire versions) do not willingly attack the Cat Lord, though they can be forced to do so by magic. If the Cat Lord attacks a feline, its protection against that creature ends.

AAA	KEY:CatLord ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CatLordRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Howl (Su) When the Cat Lord howls, all creatures except felines within a 20-foot spread must succeed on a DC 24 Will save or be stunned for 1d2 rounds. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the Cat Lord's howl for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:CatLord ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CatLordRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Immortality (Su) The Cat Lord is effectively immortal and nearly impossible to slay. When slain, the Cat Lord's soul reforms on the Astral Plane. Within 9 days, it inhabits another feline on the Material Plane and the Cat Lord reforms. No form of magic (such as magic that would contain or trap his soul) prevents this. To permanently kill the Cat Lord, it is thought that one must destroy every feline in existence (so his soul has no creature to inhabit).

AAA	KEY:CatLord ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CatLordRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

Crystal Breath (Ex) Three times per day, as a standard action, a caterprism can spew forth a crystalline silk-like substance in a cone to a range of 20 feet. The substance instantly solidifies to a rock-like hardness, forming needlesharp spears of crystal that impale those in the area and deal 3d6 points of piercing damage.

AAA	KEY:Caterprism ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CaterprismRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Crystalline Mandibles (Ex) The mandibles of a caterprism are so sharp that they can bite through nearly anything.  The bite attack of a caterprism is treated like a touch attack; i.e., it ignores any armor bonus. Further, the bite of a caterprism is considered to have the vorpal special quality, and on a successful critical hit with its bite attack, the caterprism severs the head of its opponent.

A cave moray's recoil attack is always considered a charge attack since it recoils into its cyst after an attack to lunge at its opponent again.

-----------------------------------------------

Cave Troll

AAA	KEY:CaveTroll ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CaveTrollRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Haste (Su) A cave troll is affected by a permanent haste spell (caster level 8th). This grants the cave troll a +1 bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves (both already figured into the stat block above). Any condition that makes the cave troll lose its Dexterity bonus to AC also makes it lose its dodge bonus. This is an inherent bonus and cannot be dispelled or negated.  When making a full attack action, a cave troll can make one extra attack with any weapon it is holding or one extra claw attack (if using natural weapons). The extra attack is at the cave troll's full attack bonus.

AAA	KEY:CaveTroll ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CaveTrollRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Spider Climb (Su) A cave troll can climb sheer surfaces as though by a spider climb spell (caster level 4th). This ability is always active, but can be negated or dispelled.  The cave troll can restart it again on its next turn as a free action.

Fear Gaze (Su) Paralyzed with fear 1d4 rounds, range 30 feet, Will DC 16 negates and renders target immune to this ability for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:CerebralStalker ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CerebralStalkerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Cocoon (Ex) Once per round as a standard action, and no more than three times per day, a cerebral stalker can cocoon a grappled foe by shooting sticky webbing from its body. The webs cover as much of the victim as possible, excluding the top of the victim's head, its eyes, and its nose. The webs remain attached to the cerebral stalker's body and stretch from just under its arms to its knees. A cocooned victim is anchored to the cerebral stalker and cannot move. The cocooned creature can, as a standard action, break free with a successful DC 20 Strength check or DC 16 Escape Artist check. The webbing has 8 hit points. Note the victim is still grappled even if it breaks the webbing and must succeed at a grapple check to get completely free of the cerebral stalker's grasp. The check DCs are Constitution-based and the Strength check includes a +4 racial bonus. Once a victim is cocooned, the cerebral stalker can use its sink ability.

AAA	KEY:CerebralStalker ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CerebralStalkerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Consume Brain (Ex) Once it has its victim underground, the cerebral stalker begins gnawing on the victim's head, rapidly chewing through bone and tissue, dealing 2d8+4 points of damage each round. When the victim dies, the cerebral stalker has reached its goal-the victim's brain, which it promptly devours. A victim slain in this manner is ejected from the ground and becomes a zombie (see below).

AAA	KEY:CerebralStalker ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CerebralStalkerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Create Zombie (Su) A creature whose brain is devoured by a cerebral stalker is ejected from the ground and animates as a zombie in 1d4 rounds. Zombies created in this manner are not under the control of the cerebral stalker.

AAA	KEY:CerebralStalker ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CerebralStalkerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Earth Glide (Ex) A cerebral stalker can glide through any sort of natural earth or stone as easily as a fish swims through water.  Its gliding leaves no sign of its passage or hint of its presence to creatures that don't possess tremorsense.

AAA	KEY:CerebralStalker ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CerebralStalkerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Sink (Su) After cocooning a foe, the cerebral stalker begins sinking into the ground, taking the cocooned victim with it. It takes four full rounds for the stalker and foe to completely sink into the ground. In the first round, the creature sinks to its knees; in the second round to its waist; in the third round to its neck; and in the last round, both stalker and foe are completely underground.  Sinking is a move action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.  Creatures attempting to grab the cocooned victim and prevent the sinking must first break or burn the webbing (see above), and then succeed at a grapple check against the cerebral stalker. A dispel magic (or similar effect) cast on a sinking cerebral stalker paralyzes it (as if by a hold monster spell) for a number of rounds equal to the caster's level if the stalker fails a Fortitude save. The stalker can make a new save each round to negate the paralysis. The stalker and victim sink to a depth of 10 feet where the victim is placed in a stasis (similar to temporal stasis). The spot where the cerebral stalker and victim sunk radiates magic and can be detected normally. Spells such as locate object, discern location, scrying, and other divinatory magic reveals the entombed creature and stalker. A freedom spell cast on the spot where the stalker and victim sunk immediately frees the subject from the webbing and ejects both it and the stalker, who is stunned for 1 round, to the surface.

A Styx elemental uses the standard 16 HD water elemental statistics with the following additional special attack: An opponent hit by a Styx elemental's slam attack must succeed on a DC 23 Will save or forget everything about its past life (treat this as a feeblemind spell). The save DC is Constitution-based. Even if the save is successful, the opponent acts as if affected by a confusion spell (CL 20th) for one day. The confusion effects can be removed using break enchantment, dispel magic, or greater magic.  Charon can have only one Styx elemental in existence at one time. A Styx elemental is

AAA	KEY:Chrystone ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ChrystoneRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A chrystone is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A transmute rock to mud spell slows a chrystone (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost hit points.  A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the chrystone's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round.

Church Grim

AAA	KEY:ChurchGrim ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ChurchGrimRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Howl (Su) The howl of a church grim causes any evil creature within its limited domain (its churchyard; see below) to make a successful DC 16 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. Good or neutral creatures are completely unaffected by the howl as long as they are not there to steal from the dead or attack the church. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be affected by the same church grim's howl for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:ChurchGrim ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ChurchGrimRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:

AAA	KEY:ChurchGrim ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ChurchGrimRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Limited Domain (Ex) The realm of a church grim encompasses only the churchyard it defends; it can wander freely in its cemetery and any adjoining church grounds, but it cannot move beyond; it must stop at the boundary of consecrated land.

AAA	KEY:ChurchGrim ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ChurchGrimRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Rejuvenation (Su) It is difficult to destroy a church grim through simple combat. A slain church grim restores itself within 24 hours. Even the most powerful spells are often only temporary solutions. A church grim that would otherwise be destroyed returns to its churchyard with a successful level check (1d20 + the church grim's HD) against DC 16.  The only sure way to get rid of a church grim is to raze the church it protects and cast unhallow on the churchyard.  Soul Defender (Su) It is the sacred duty of a church grim to defend the bodies and souls of those buried in its churchyard. Any attempts to cast an animate dead or similar spell to create undead within the confines of an area guarded by a church grim requires the caster to make a successful DC 20 caster level check. If the check fails, the spell fizzles away just as if it had been cast. Whether the check succeeds or not, the caster incurs the full wrath of the church grim immediately.

Cinder Ghoul

AAA	KEY:CinderGhoul ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CinderGhoulRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Limited Gaseous Form (Ex) Because it has solid body parts that constantly float and swirl within it, a cinder ghoul has a limited version of the gaseous form ability. Although other gaseous creatures can issue under the crack of a door, a cinder ghoul cannot. A cinder ghoul can, however, make slam attacks, retains its natural armor bonus, and all supernatural attacks. Spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities affect them normally. A cinder ghoul cannot enter water or other liquid. It is not ethereal or incorporeal, and is affected by winds or other forms of moving air to the extent that the wind pushes them in the direction the wind is moving.  However, even the strongest wind can't disperse or damage a cinder ghoul. Because it contains burning embers and small bits of perpetually smoldering flesh, a cinder ghoul cannot hide and gets no bonuses to Stealth checks in an area of mist, smoke, or other gas.

AAA	KEY:CinderGhoul ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CinderGhoulRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Smoke Inhalation (Su) As a standard action, a cinder ghoul can attempt to force some of its smoky form into the lungs of a living opponent. To initiate this attack it must move into its target's space. The target must then make a successful DC 18 Fortitude save or inhale part of the creature. Smoke inside the victim's lungs burns the surrounding tissues and organs, dealing 1d2 points of Constitution damage each round.

AAA	KEY:Clamor ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClamorRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Natural Invisibility (Su) As creatures of living sound, a clamor is naturally invisible, even when it attacks. This ability is inherent and is not subject to the invisibility purge spell.

AAA	KEY:Clamor ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClamorRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Sound Mimicry (Ex) A clamor can duplicate any sound it has ever encountered with perfect accuracy as a free action. It can use this ability to duplicate speech, music, or any other auditory phenomenon, although sounds with magical properties (such as power word spells) lose their magical effects when duplicated.

AAA	KEY:Clamor ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClamorRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Sonic Burst (Ex) A clamor can emit a massive onslaught of sonic energy as a full-round action that can be heard for miles in all directions. Any living creature within 100 feet of the clamor must make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d3 rounds. Furthermore, living creatures within 50 feet of the clamor must make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save or be permanently deafened. A restoration, wish, miracle, or remove blindness/deafness spell restores hearing and negates the stunning effect. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:Clamor ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClamorRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Speed of Sound (Ex) Once per day, a clamor can move at the speed of sound for a number of minutes equal to its Hit Dice. Its fly speed increases to 6,820 ft. (34,100 squares), but it cannot attack or use of any of its other abilities when moving this way.

AAA	KEY:Clamor ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClamorRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Sound-Related Vulnerabilities (Ex) Any magical silence effect or effect that creates a vacuum deals 3d6 points of damage to a clamor and forces it to make a successful Fortitude save (DC equal to 10 + spell level + spell caster's appropriate ability score modifier) or become panicked for 1 minute. In addition, the following spells can affect a clamor in unusual ways.  Ghost sound, major image, minor image, message, ventriloquism, whispering wind: These magically generated or altered sounds force a clamor to make a Will save (DC 10 + spell level + the caster's appropriate ability score modifier) or act as though affected by a confusion spell for a number of rounds equal to the caster's level.  Sculpt sound: If targeted directly at the clamor, this spell deals 1d4 points of damage per caster level. The clamor is allowed a Fortitude save for half damage. Alternately, a bard (and only a bard) using sculpt sound can attempt to completely control the actions of a clamor. The clamor is allowed an initial Fortitude save to negate the effect; if it fails, it is controlled as if by a dominate monster spell with a caster level equal to that of the bard's class level.  Shout, sound burst: These spells do no damage to a clamor, but force it to make a Will save or be affected as if by a charm monster spell with a caster level equal to that of the caster.

Clockwork Brain Gear

AAA	KEY:ClockworkBrainGear ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClockworkBrainGearRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Control Clockwork (Su) Any clockwork that comes within two miles of a brain gear immediately falls under that brain gear's control. If more than one brain gear attempts to control a clockwork (or if the clockwork is under the control of another brain gear or overseer), each gear must make an opposed Intelligence check; the winner gains control of that clockwork. When a clockwork moves more than 2 miles away from a brain gear, it continues to perform the last order given to it, but there is a 25% percent chance each hour that it ceases to function, collapsing into a pile of junk. If a brain gear later moves within two miles of the destroyed clockwork, the clockwork can reactivate if it has the self-repair ability. Otherwise, it remains destroyed. A brain gear in control of at least one clockwork can, as a free action once per round, use that clockwork to perceive the world through its senses (such as seeing the area surrounding the clockwork). This ability has a range of 2 miles. If a brain gear controls multiple clockworks, it can instantaneously jump from clockwork to clockwork, keeping tabs on all of its thralls and perceiving the world through their senses. A brain gear can switch control from one clockwork to another once per round as a free action. A brain gear uses this ability to give commands to its clockworks, allowing the usually mindless creatures to fight with highly coordinated tactics. Each clockwork is capable of receiving roughly 100 words worth of orders. Anything beyond that is too complicated for the clockwork to handle.

AAA	KEY:ClockworkBrainGear ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClockworkBrainGearRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Dream (Su) The brain gear has a limited ability to send psychic messages. Once per week, it can create an effect similar to a dream spell (caster level 10th). The brain gear can contact multiple creatures by designating a generic creature type, such as ogre or human. This designation affects every member of the target type within a 2-mile radius of the brain gear.

Clockwork Overseer

AAA	KEY:ClockworkOverseer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClockworkOverseerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Independent Clockwork (Su) An overseer can move beyond the brain gear's normal area of influence while maintaining contact with it. Normally, a brain gear can control only clockworks that are within two miles of its position. A brain gear can control an overseer that stays within 10 miles of its position. In addition, the overseer can act as a field commander for up to 20 HD worth of clockworks that are within 100 feet of its position. These clockworks are considered to be in contact with the brain gear so long as the overseer is in contact with it.

Clockwork Parasite

AAA	KEY:ClockworkParasite ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClockworkParasiteRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Control Host (Su) By burrowing into the base of a corpse's skull and attaching itself with its pincers, a parasite clockwork can animate the creature (similar to an animate dead spell). The animated creature uses its own HD, base attack, saves, and hit points. It has an effective Wisdom of 10 and Charisma of 1. It does not have an Intelligence score. The host loses all skills, feats, class abilities, supernatural abilities, and spell-like abilities (including the ability to cast spells) it possessed in life. It retains its AC and any natural attacks it possessed, including proficiency with weapons. A host retains any proficiency with armor and shields it possessed while alive.  Spells such as detect undead or detect magic do not reveal the presence of the parasite or host. So long as the parasite clockwork remains in contact with the host, the control remains in effect.  A host brought to 0 or less hit points is destroyed, but can be repaired by the clockwork parasite using its self-repair ability (though this only works if the host is brought to 0 or less hit points; a host does not gain the self-repair ability of the parasite while "alive").

AAA	KEY:ClockworkParasite ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClockworkParasiteRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Self-Repair (Ex) A clockwork parasite regains 1 hit point per round. Damage dealt from acid, cold, or fire effects cannot be self-repaired. If reduced to 0 or less hit points, it regains 1 hit point per round (but still cannot repair damage caused by acid, cold, or fire effects).

Animal Appearance (Ex) Clockwork scouts are constructed to resemble small animals such as badgers, dogs, or cats. Often, their inner wood and metal workings are covered by an animal's pelt, while their frame is specially constructed to help reinforce the illusion that they are an animal. A character must succeed on a DC 15 Knowledge (nature), Perception or Survival check to notice that the scout is not an actual animal.

Self-Repair (Ex) A clockwork swarm regains 3 hit points per round. Damage dealt from acid, cold, or fire effects cannot be self-repaired. If a clockwork swarm takes damage from an area attack, it is unable to repair itself for 1d6 rounds following the attack. If reduced to 0 or less hit points, it regains 1 hit point per round (but still cannot repair damage caused by acid, cold, or fire effects) until it has at least 1 hit point (at which time it begins to self-repair at its normal rate of 3 hit points per round).

Cloud Dragon

AAA	KEY:CloudDragon ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CloudDragonRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Breath Weapon (Su) A cloud dragon's breath weapon is a powerful cone of icy cold air. When a cloud dragon uses its breath weapon, make a single bull rush attack using the dragon's CMB against the CMD of any creature that failed its Reflex save and is three or more size categories smaller than the dragon. This bull rush does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and the dragon cannot choose to move with any opponent pushed back. In addition to being pushed back, affected creatures are knocked prone and take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet they are pushed back. Flying creatures are buffeted and pushed back twice the distance and sustain 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet they are pushed back.

AAA	KEY:CloudDragon ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CloudDragonRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Cold Bite (Su) At old age, a cloud dragon's bite deals an additional 2d6 points of cold damage. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym's to 6d6.

AAA	KEY:CloudDragon ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CloudDragonRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:

AAA	KEY:CloudDragon ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CloudDragonRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Immunity to Winds (Su) A cloud dragon is immune to the effects of wind. It ignores the penalties applied to the Fly skill incurred by wind speed, and is immune to the negative   effects of any spell or effect that manipulates wind, such as gust of wind and whirlwind.

Spell-like Abilities A cloud dragon gains the following spelllike abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Young-create water; Juvenile-obscuring mist; Adult-stinking cloud; Old-call lightning; Ancient-control winds; Great Wyrm-control weather.

AAA	KEY:CofferCorpse ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CofferCorpseRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Deceiving Death (Ex) In any round in which a coffer corpse is struck for 6 or more points of damage (whether the damage bypasses the creature's damage reduction or not), the creature slumps to the ground, seemingly destroyed. If it has fastened its death grip on a victim, it releases its hold when it falls. A DC 20 Sense Motive check sees through the ruse (necromancers gain a +2 competence bonus on this check). On its next turn, the coffer corpse rises again as if reanimated, triggering its fear ability.

AAA	KEY:CofferCorpse ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CofferCorpseRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:

Hypnotic Lights (Su) The corpse candle possesses the ability to create a dancing, twisting pattern of ever-shifting lights that slowly change colors.  The corpse candle can create these lights within 20 feet of itself, covering an area in a 10foot radius spread (usually underwater). Creatures viewing the pattern within 50 feet must make a successful Will save (DC 18) or become fascinated. If the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by that corpse candle's hypnotic lights for one day. The lights remain for as long as the corpse candle concentrates plus 1 minute. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. A fascinated victim moves toward the lights, taking the most direct route available at its normal movement rate. The creature avoids certain dangers (walking off a cliff, walking through fire, etc.) and skirts around such obstructions if possible, but it will swim towards the light if necessary, paying no heed to the need for air. If no path to the light is available, the fascination is broken. Any living creature within the area of light at the end of its turn takes 1d2 points of Constitution damage. This is a death effect.

An unconscious or dying opponent can make a DC 25 Fortitude save to prevent the absorption. A dead opponent gets no saving throw. The sa DC is Constitution-based. When it absorbs a body the corpse orgy gains 12 temporary hit points. A creature whose body is absorbed can only be raised or resurrected if the corpse orgy that absorbed its body is slain and the corpse in question is recovered.

Corruptor Demon

AAA	KEY:CorruptorDemon ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorruptorDemonRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Whisper of Madness (Su) When summoned, a demon of corruption automatically establishes a mental link between itself and the one who summoned it (the host). Distance is not a factor to maintain the link, and it can span across planes and dimensions. The demon need not concentrate to maintain the link. A corruptor demon can have in existence at one time a number of links equal to its current HD. A corruptor demon can break a link it has established any time as a free action.  The link allows the demon to speak (as if by telepathy) to the host and submit subconscious thoughts and messages to him or her. Once per task requested of the corruptor demon (or once per week if no task is requested, including fractions of a week if dismissed early), as long as the link is in existence, the host must succeed on a Will save (DC 11 barizou; DC 12 azizou; DC 13 geruzou) or have his alignment shift one increment toward chaotic evil; first along the good-evil axis and then along the lawful-chaotic axis. The save DC is Charisma-based and increases by +1 each week the link is maintained. A successful save prevents the alignment shift for that week but does not break the link.  When  the  host's  alignment  completely  shifts  to chaotic evil (or if the host is chaotic evil when the link  is  first  established),  he  must  immediately succeed on a Will save (DC 15 barizou; DC 16 azizou; DC 17 geruzou) or go permanently insane (as if affected by an insanity spell, caster level 8th). The save DCs are Charisma-based and include a +4 racial bonus.  A  successful  save  negates  the  insanity for  one  month,  after  which  time  a  new save  (same  DC)  must  be  made  again. This cycle continues until the host fails  a save and goes insane or until the link between  host  and  corruptor  demon  is broken. The  link  is  blocked  by  lead  and magical  protection  (antimagic  field,  mind blank, and nondetection) and can be dispelled through magical means (dispel magic, greater restoration, and the like).  The  alignment  shift  caused  by  these  demons can only be removed after the link is broken. This requires the host to voluntarily (meaning no magical intervention such as charm person or suggestion) subject himself to a greater restoration spell. One such spell is needed for each shift along the law-chaos and good-evil axes. If the host was originally good-aligned, he must voluntarily subject himself to an atonement spell.

AAA	KEY:CorruptorDemon ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorruptorDemonRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:

Wounding Gaze (Su) A living creature within 30 feet that meets the gaze of a crimson basilisk must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or take 1d3 points of Constitution damage as blood weeps from the victim's eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. Creatures without blood (undead, plants, oozes) and other crimson basilisks are immune to the effects of this gaze. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Crucifixion Spirit

AAA	KEY:CrucifixionSpirit ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CrucifixionSpiritRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Crucify Soul (Su) Five times per day as an attack action a crucifixion spirit can point at a single living target within 60 feet and crucify its soul. This requires the crucifixion spirit to succeed at a ranged touch attack. If successful, the target's soul is ripped from its body, which collapses in a heap on the ground. The target's soul appears as a translucent copy of the victim and is suspended above the spot its body collapsed, crucified in midair to a translucent, "X" shaped structure, the soul held in place by translucent spikes or nails. The victim is not dead and is visible to all those viewing it. A crucified soul cannot be attacked or affected by anything, cannot take any actions (other than trying to escape, see below), and experiences excruciating pain that deals 2 negative levels to it in the round it is crucified, and one negative level each round thereafter. The Fortitude save to remove a negative level has a DC of 22. The save DCs are Charisma-based. A crucifixion spirit does not need to concentrate on this ability for it to continue to affect a target. It can direct attacks against a different opponent. A crucified creature can attempt to escape each round by making a DC 22 Will save. If successful, the creature's soul is freed from its torment and returns to its body in the same round. The target is stunned for one round, but afterwards can act normally. A creature slain with this ability cannot be returned to life except through the casting of a wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell. Even then, there is a 50% chance that such magic fails. If the check fails, the creature cannot be restored to life by mortal magic.

Roll randomly for each creature that fails its saving throw.  A teleported creature arrives in the closest open space at the determined destination. A teleported creature can arrive in mid-air rather than on a solid surface, if the crypt thing wishes. A creature that arrives in mid-air takes falling damage when it contacts a solid surface (unless it has some means to prevent falling, such as the ability to fly, or a feather fall spell).

Armor or clothing worn by a creature grappled by a crystal ooze takes the same amount of acid damage unless the wearer succeeds on a DC 20 Reflex saving throw. A wooden or metal weapon that strikes a crystal ooze takes 1d6 acid damage unless the weapon's wielder succeeds on a DC 20 Reflex save. The ooze's touch deals 12 points of acid damage per round to wooden or metal objects, but the ooze must remain in contact with the material for 1 full round in order to deal this damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:DemiLich ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DemiLichRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A demi-lich is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A shatter spell deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6), with no saving throw.  A power word kill spell cast by an ethereal caster deals 50 points of damage to the demi-lich if it fails a Fortitude save (DC 19 + caster's relevant ability score modifier). Note: power word kill does not normally allow a save.) A holy smite spell affects the demi-lich normally.  A dispel evil spell deals 2d6 points of damage, with no saving throw.

AAA	KEY:DemiLich ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DemiLichRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:

Trap the Soul (Su) A demi-lich can trap the souls of up to eight living creatures per day. To use this power, it selects any target it can see within 300 feet. The target is allowed a DC 22 Fortitude saving throw. If the target makes its saving throw, it gains three negative levels (this does not count as a use of trap the soul). If the target fails its save, the soul of the target is instantly drawn from its body and trapped within one of the gems incorporated into the demi-lich's mouth. The gem gleams for 24 hours, indicating the captive soul within. The soulless body collapses in a mass of corruption and molders in a single round, reduced to dust. If left to its own devices, the demi-lich slowly devours the soul over 24 hours-at the end of that time the sou l is completely absorbed, and the victim is forever gone.  If the demi-lich is overcome before the soul is eaten, crushing the gem releases the soul, after which time it is free to seek the afterlife or be returned to its body by the use of resurrection, true resurrection, clone, or miracle. A potential victim protected by a death ward spell is not immune to trap the soul, but receives a +5 bonus on its Fortitude save and is effective against the level loss on a successful save.  The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:DemiLich ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DemiLichRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:

If the save succeeds, that creature cannot be affected again by the same demiurge's soul touch for one day. This is a death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:Demiurge ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DemiurgeRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:

Note that the fen witch does not need to speak a language the creature understands in order to affect it; she only needs to speak its true name. Other fen witches or creatures who hear the target's true name cannot use this ability; it only functions for the fen witch after she has used her mind probe ability on the target. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Whether the fen witch's Death Speak ability is successful or not, the target's name remains fresh in her mind for 24 hours.

Creatures with an Intelligence score of 2 or less and creatures with no Intelligence score are immune to this ability. Psionic creatures can use defense modes or other psionic abilities to counter this probe. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same fen witch's mind probe for one day.

AAA	KEY:FireElementalConstruct ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FireElementalConstructRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A fire elemental construct is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance.  In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A cold effect slows a fire elemental construct (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds with no saving throw. This is in addition to any damage it takes because of its vulnerability to cold.  A quench spell negates the fire elemental construct's damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 round. Any water-based spell of 5th level or higher deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the fire elemental construct. The construct can attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + spell level + caster's relevant ability score modifier) to half the damage.  Any fire-based spell or effect heals 1 point of damage on the fire elemental construct for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal.

Immolation (Su) Normally used as a last resort, a fire phantom can detonate itself in an inferno of elemental fire that deals 6d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 10-foot radius. A successful DC 15 Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Charisma-based. This instantly kills the fire phantom if it fails a DC 20 Will save.  Even if the fire phantom survives, its flames are extinguished for 1 minute. During this time the fire phantom cannot use its fire blast ability and cannot deal fire damage with its slam attack. It retains the fire subtype. After 1 minute, its fires relight and it may deal fire damage normally and use its fire blast ability.

Energy Absorption (Su) Any energy-based (acid, fire, cold, electricity, sonic) attack that directly targets a flagstone golem is absorbed into its body dealing no damage to the golem. A flagstone golem can use the absorbed energy to repair itself, healing 1 hit point for every 3 points of damage the attack would have otherwise dealt.

A transmute mud to rock spell heals all its lost hit points.  A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the golem's structure, but it negates the flagstone golem's damage reduction for 1 round.

It can climb back up this rope at a speed of 10 feet per round. Once the snail breaks contact with the rope, the slime decomposes in 1d4 rounds, after which it cannot be used by the snail or any other creatures.

Animate Dead (Su) The electrical aura of the fogwarden can animate dead creatures within 20 feet. This is otherwise identical to an animate dead (caster level 4th). The animated creatures resemble zombies (and use their stats) and are under the control of the fogwarden that animated them. They are not undead however, and cannot be turned or rebuked. If the fogwarden is slain or moves more than 20 feet from a zombie, the animated creature collapses dead and cannot be animated again.

AAA	KEY:AAA ~ Fogwarden	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FogwardenRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Electricity Discharge (Su) Electricity constantly plays across a fogwarden's form. Any metal object (including metal weapons) that contacts a fogwarden's body takes 3d6 points of electricity damage. Magic items receive a DC 13 Reflex saving throw to reduce the damage by half.  Nonmagical items and objects receive no save and automatically take full damage. A creature holding the object or weapon at the time of contact takes 3d6 points of electricity damage as well (DC 13 Reflex save for half).

AAA	KEY:AAA ~ Fogwarden	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FogwardenRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Gaseous Form (Ex) The fogwarden's natural form is that of fog or mist. This ability is similar to the gaseous form spell (caster level 8th), except that a fogwarden does not lose its supernatural abilities or its lightning bolt ability, and has a fly speed of 40 feet. It is immune to and cannot perform combat maneuvers.

AAA	KEY:AAA ~ Fogwarden	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FogwardenRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

Forester's Bane

AAA	KEY:ForestersBane ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ForestersBaneRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Snap and Saw (Ex) A forester's bane can saw at an opponent, dealing slashing damage, when it makes a successful grapple check. This attack deals 1d4+3 points of slashing damage per stalk. It cannot attack a pinned opponent with any stalk that has already attacked another opponent that round. A forester's bane can only attempt to grapple opponents 1 or more sizes smaller than itself. Because of its four leaves, it can grapple up to four different opponents at one time with a single grapple check. It can also attack a single opponent with more than one leaf, gaining a +2 bonus on its grapple check with each extra leaf (+13 grapple with two leaves, +15 grapple with three leaves, and +17 grapple with all four leaves).  Both leaves and stalks each have 10 hit points and can be attacked by making a successful sunder attempt. Attacking a forester's bane's leaf or stalk does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the leaf is currently grappling a target, the forester's bane takes a -4 penalty on its opposed roll to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a leaf or stalk deals no damage to a forester's bane. Attacks that hit a leaf deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.  Destroyed leaves and stalks grow back in 2d4 weeks if the forester's bane is not killed.

Fungus Weird

AAA	KEY:FungusWeird ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FungusWeirdRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Camouflage (Ex) A fungus weird is effectively invisible in its pool until it attacks. It takes a successful DC 20 Spot check to notice a fungus weird in its pool before it attacks.  Fungus Pool: A fungus weird's "pool" is not a pool at all, but an entanglement of leaves, branches, mosses, funguses, and plants. A typical pool covers a 20-foot radius, and a fungus weird (being bound to its pool) can never leave this area.  A creature that enters a fungus weird's pool (on its own or with the aid of the fungus weird) is automatically entangled (as the entangle spell) until it escapes. An entangled creature can break free and move half its normal speed by using a full-round action to make a DC 15 Escape Artist check or a DC 19 Strength check. The check DCs are Constitution-based and the Strength check includes a +4 racial bonus.

AAA	KEY:FungusWeird ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FungusWeirdRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Sleep Spores (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds, as a standard action, a fungus weird can release a puff of greenish-yellow spores in a 10-foot cone. These spores induce sleep (as the sleep spell) if the opponent fails a DC 15 Will save. Unlike the sleep spell, there is no HD limit or maximum HD affected. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Furnace Golem

AAA	KEY:FurnaceGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FurnaceGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Furnace-Interior (Ex) A furnace golem can try to shove a grabbed opponent up to two sizes smaller than itself into its interior by making a successful grapple check.  An opponent thrown into the furnace golem's interior is trapped as a metal grating closes over the opening in the same round. A trapped creature automatically takes 2d6 points of fire damage each round. Escaping the creature's interior requires a successful Strength check (DC 30) to bend the bars. Alternately a trapped creature can escape by dealing at least 25 points of damage to the bars (AC 22). Note, the golem's damage reduction applies to all attacks against the bars.  A Huge furnace golem's interior can hold 2 Medium, 8 Small, or 16 Tiny or smaller creatures.

AAA	KEY:FurnaceGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FurnaceGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

AAA	KEY:FurnaceGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FurnaceGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A furnace golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance.  In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature as noted below.  A magical attack that bypasses its cold resistance slows a furnace golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw.  A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the furnace golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of damage would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.

Any creature within or entering this area must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability and skill checks, and weapon damage rolls for as long as they remain within the area. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the aura of despair of that fye for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:Fye ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FyeRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Possession (Su) Once per round by making a successful incorporeal touch attack, a fye can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell, except that it does not require a receptacle. The target can resist the possession by succeeding on a DC 15 Will save.

Spore Cloud (Ex) As a free action, once every 1d4 rounds (but no more than three times per day), a gallows tree zombie can breathe a cloud of poisonous, greenish spores in a 5-foot cube directly in front of it. A creature caught in the cloud must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or be slowed (as the slow spell) for 6 rounds.

This vine can be lengthened to allow the zombie to move up to 100 feet away from the tree. The vine is AC 19 (touch 12) and has 10 hit points. Harming the vine deals no damage to the gallows tree zombie or the gallows tree, but if severed, does prevent the zombie from using its fast healing ability.

AAA	KEY:GallowsTree ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GallowsTreeRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Create Gallows Tree Zombie (Su) When a creature dies within 15 feet of a gallows tree, it uses a sharpened tendril to slice open the creature's abdomen, thereby spilling the corpse's innards on the ground. The organs and fluids are then absorbed by the tree's roots.  Corpses of a size other than Medium or Large are simply left to rot. Medium or Large corpses are filled with a greenish pollen fired from one of the tree's branches. The abdominal wound heals over the next 1d4 days, at which time the slain creature rises as a gallows tree zombie connected by a tether-vine to the gallows tree that created it. Gallows tree zombies possess none of their former abilities.

AAA	KEY:GallowsTree ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GallowsTreeRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

Engulf (Ex) A gelatinous golem can try to wrap an opponent up to one size smaller than itself in its body as a standard action. The gelatinous golem attempts a grapple that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple the gelatinous golem establishes a hold. Attacks that hit an engulfing gelatinous golem deal half their damage to the golem and half to the engulfed victim.  An engulfed opponent is subjected to the gelatinous golem's paralysis and acid each round it remains trapped. A trapped opponent can do nothing other than attempt to escape. Further, an engulfed foe must hold its breath or begin drowning (see the Core Rulebook for the drowning rules).  While engulfing an opponent, a gelatinous golem is not considered grappled and can move and attack normally.

AAA	KEY:GelatinousGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GelatinousGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

Feeding destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising and resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic.  A ghaddar advances in Hit Dice by consuming corpses in this fashion. For every three suitable corpses a ghaddar devours, it gains 1 Hit Die, and its Strength, Constitution, and natural armor increase by +1. Its attack bonus and saves improve as normal for an outsider of its Hit Dice, and it gains skill points, feats, and ability score improvements normally.  The ghaddar only advances by consuming the corpses of creatures whose Hit Dice or levels are equal to or greater than its own current total.

AAA	KEY:Gorgimera ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GorgimeraRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Breath Weapon (Su) A gorgimera has two breath weapons, each of which can be used independently of the other (thus it can breathe twice in a given round as a single standard action).

Dragon A gorgimera's dragon head breath weapon depends on the color of its dragon head, as summarized on the table below. Regardless of its type, a gorgimera's breath weapon is usable once every 1d4 rounds, deals 3d8 points of damage, and allows a DC 21 Reflex save for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.  To determine a gorgimera's head color and breath weapon randomly, roll 1d10 and consult the table below.

1d10 | Head Color | Breath Weapon |

Gravity Elemental

AAA	KEY:GravityElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GravityElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Distortion (Su) The manipulation of light waves around a gravity elemental grants it a +2 deflection bonus to its Armor Class.

AAA	KEY:GravityElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GravityElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Engulf (Ex) A gravity elemental that starts its turn grappling a creature or holding and object up to one size smaller than itself can absorb the creature or object into its swirling form as a full-round action. An engulfed creature or object takes damage equal to the elemental's slam attack each round it remains engulfed and can take no action other than trying to break free by rolling its CMB vs. the gravity elementals CMD. The gravity elemental gains the grappled condition as long as it has a creature engulfed, and it can only engulf one creature at a time.  A creature that dies while engulfed by a gravity elemental is smashed into atoms and can only be restored to life by a miracle, wish, or the intervention of a deity. An object that is destroyed while it is engulfed by a gravity elemental is destroyed forever and cannot be restored. There is a 1% non-cumulative chance each round that an engulfed creature or object is sent to a random plane.

AAA	KEY:GravityElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GravityElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Missile Weapons (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to any attack from thrown or hurled weapons, arrows, bolts, stones, and similar weapons with a size equal to or less than its own. Any such ranged attack against a gravity elemental automatically fails and the weapon is pulled into the elemental's body.  Captured missiles orbit the gravity elemental's form as long as it desires, and it can release one such missile each round as an improvised thrown weapon.  The weapon deals its normal damage plus the gravity elemental's Strength modifier, and has a range increment of 20 ft. A gravity elemental has the Throw Anything feat as a bonus feat.

AAA	KEY:GravityElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GravityElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Gravity Field (Su) A gravity elemental's manipulation of gravity function like the reverse gravity and telekinesis spells (CL equal to HD). The maximum weight an Elder gravity elemental can lift with its telekinesis is not restricted to 375 lbs. The effects of the gravity field are centered on the gravity elemental and move with it. Additionally, by increasing the pull of gravity around itself a gravity elemental can make creatures within a certain radius too heavy to move, or crush them to a pulp.  Hold: As a full-round action a gravity elemental can cause all corporeal creatures in its area of effect to become too heavy to move. Creatures in the gravity elemental's gravity field must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the held condition until the gravity elemental releases them or they break free. A flying creature has a -4 penalty applied to the save; failure means it is unable to remain airborne and must land. The check DC is Strength-based. The gravity elemental can maintain this ability each round as a fullround action.  The area of effect and save DC depend on the size of the elemental. If the gravity elemental maintains this ability, on successive rounds a held creature can break free by succeeding on a Strength check with a DC equal to the initial Fortitude save. Any land-bound creature two size categories smaller less than the elemental has its speed automatically reduced by half, even if the Strength check is successful.  This ability only works on creatures with weight and mass; incorporeal and gaseous creatures are immune to this power.  Crush: Once per day per 2HD, as a standard action, a gravity elemental can increase the gravity around itself to crushing proportions. Anything within the gravity elemental's gravity field takes bludgeoning damage. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. The area of effect and save DC depend on the elemental's size. The save DC is Strength-based.

AAA	KEY:GravityElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GravityElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

Perfect Flier (Ex) A gravity elemental has perfect control over the forces of gravity, and never needs to make a Fly check when attempting a complex maneuver. It must still make Fly checks to resist external influences on its flight, such as strong winds.

Graymalkin

AAA	KEY:Graymalkin ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GraymalkinRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Fascination (Su) Once per round as a standard action, a graymalkin can attempt to fascinate a single opponent. The target can make a successful Will save to resist the attempt. On a successful save, that target is immune to the fascination ability of that graymalkin for 24 hours.  If the save fails, the target becomes fascinated with the graymalkin and "adopts" it as a pet, becoming its new owner. The owner clings to the cat and always keeps it close by, feeling withdrawn and lethargic if the graymalkin is farther away. A fascinated target resists any urges or suggestions to rid itself of its new found friend, even to the point of becoming combative and enraged. This fascination lasts until the graymalkin is killed, the owner dies, or the graymalkin remains more than 20 feet away from its owner for at least 24 hours. The effect is otherwise similar to a charm person spell (caster level equals the graymalkin's HD). A graymalkin can only ever have one owner at a single time. If it uses its fascination ability against another creature, that target becomes its new owner on a failed save. All fascination effects on its previous owner are immediately dispelled. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:GreaterBoneneedle ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GreaterBoneneedleRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Poison (Ex) The bite of a boneneedle secretes a thick, syrupy neurotoxin that destroys flesh and quickly breaks down bone. The chemical reaction causes the bones to weaken and become brittle. If the opponent fails his save against the poison's secondary effect, its bones weaken, and it takes an extra 2 points of damage from any crushing or bludgeoning attack until all Dexterity damage dealt by marrow poisoning is healed. Cumulative bites do not increase the amount of extra damage beyond 2 points An opponent reduced to Dexterity 0 dies as its bones become too brittle to support its weight thus causing its body to collapse in on itself. Creatures without bone structures, such as constructs (except those crafted from bone), oozes, and plants, are immune to the effects of marrow poisoning.  Bone Needle Poison; Sting-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; effect 1d4 Dex; secondary effect: target takes an extra 2 points of damage from crushing or bludgeoning attacks until all Dex damage is healed; cure 1 save.

AAA	KEY:Gryph ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GryphRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Implant Eggs (Ex) Once per day, a gryph can implant eggs into a helpless target or a target that it is currently attached to as a full-round action by extending an ovipositor from its abdomen and penetrating the victim's flesh by making a successful +4 melee attack. On a hit, the ovipositor inflicts 1 damage and implants 1d4 eggs into the victim's body. As long as a victim has gryph eggs implanted in his body, he is sickened as the eggs draw nutrients from his blood and flesh. The eggs grow swiftly, hatching in a mere 1d4 minutes into ravenous baby gryphs that immediately burrow out of the victim's body. This inflicts 2 points of Constitution damage per baby gryph, after which the hatchlings immediately take wing and fly away.  Treat a gryph hatchling as a bat if statistics are needed.  Gryph eggs can be cut out of a victim's body with a successful DC 20 Heal check made as a full-round action that inflicts 1 point of damage per attempt. Although immunity to disease offers no special protection against gryph egg implantation, remove disease or heal immediately destroys any implanted gryph eggs.

AAA	KEY:Gutslug ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GutslugRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

A pint of alcohol poured or thrown on a gutslug deals no damage but causes it to lose its racial bonus to grapple checks.

Hanged Man

AAA	KEY:HangedMan ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HangedManRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Drag (Ex) If the hanged man entangles a foe with his rope attack, it drags its opponent 10 feet closer as a standard action on each subsequent round that it succeeds on a CMB check (including a +5 racial bonus) without provoking attacks of opportunity. When an opponent is dragged within 5 feet, the hanged man can attack with both of its claws in the same round. It gains a +4 attack bonus against opponents entangled in its rope.

AAA	KEY:HangedMan ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HangedManRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Entangle (Su) The hanged man's noose is a 20-ft. length of rope that entangles opponents of any size as an animate rope spell (CL 15th, DC 21). A hanged man can lash its rope outward 20 feet with no range penalty. The rope functions only for the hanged man it belongs to and no other. It has AC 22, hardness 10, hp 10, and DR:5/slashing. If the rope is severed, both it and the hanged man are destroyed. The save DC is Strength-based.

AAA	KEY:HangmanTree ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HangmanTreeRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Hallucinatory Spores (Ex) As a standard action, a hangman tree can release a cloud of spores in a 50-foot radius spread. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or be affected as if by a charm monster spell for 2d6 minutes. Affected creatures believe the tree to be of some ordinary sort (or to be a treant or other such friendly tree creature). An affected creature becomes passive and refuses to attack the hangman tree during this time. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  An affected creature can attempt a new Will save (DC 19, +1 per previous save) each round. A creature that makes its save cannot be affected by the hallucinatory spores of that hangman's tree for 24 hours.

AAA	KEY:HangmanTree ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HangmanTreeRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

Vines (Ex) The vines of a hangman tree have 10 hit points and can be attacked by making a successful sunder attempt. Attacking a hangman tree's vine does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the vine is currently grappling a target, the hangman tree takes a -4 penalty on its opposed attack roll to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a vine deals no damage to a hangman tree.

Haunt

AAA	KEY:Haunt ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HauntRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Alternate Form (Su) A haunt's natural form is that of a translucent image appearing much as the person did in life. As a standard action, it can alter its form so as to appear as a floating, luminescent ball of light (possibly being mistaken for a will-o'-wisp in this form). In this form, it cannot use its Dexterity damage attack or its malevolence attack. It retains its incorporeal form and can make an incorporeal touch attack that deals normal damage (but not Dex damage).  A haunt remains in one form or the other until it chooses to assume a new one (as a standard action). A change in form cannot be dispelled. A haunt cannot change forms while using its malevolence attack (that is, while possessing a host).

AAA	KEY:Haunt ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HauntRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Malevolence (Su) Once per round, a haunt can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane whose Dexterity has been reduced to 0 (either through the haunt's touch or by some other means). This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th or the haunt's Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the haunt must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 14 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same haunt's malevolence for 24 hours.  If the save fails, the haunt vanishes into the target's body (whose Dexterity temporarily returns to normal) and attempts to complete its unfinished task.  If the haunt completes its task, it leaves the host and fades away forever. When the haunt leaves the host, the host's Dexterity drops back to 0. If the host body is slain while the haunt is in possession of it, the creature becomes tied to that area and can never leave. Its unfinished task remains the same.

AAA	KEY:Haunt ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HauntRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Rejuvenation (Su) In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a haunt through simple combat: the "destroyed" spirit restores itself in 1d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to permanently destroy a haunt is to use dispel evil/good/law/chaos (depending on the haunt's alignment) or determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different ghost by the GM.

AAA	KEY:Haunt ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HauntRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Strangle (Su) If a creature possessed by a haunt has an alignment opposite to that of the haunt on either the law/ chaos or good/evil axis, it attempts to strangle the host using its own hands (i.e., the hands of the host body). Unless precautions are taken to restrain the possessed victim's hands, they immediately reach for the throat and begin strangling the haunt-possessed body. An opponent takes 1d4 points of damage each round until its hands are forcibly restrained with a successful CMB check, the haunt is ejected from the body, or the victim dies.

AAA	KEY:Haunt ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HauntRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Vulnerability (Ex) A haunt can be forcibly ejected from a host if hold person is cast on the victim and the haunt fails its Will save. A dispel evil/good/law/chaos spell (depending on the haunt's alignment) instantly ejects the creature from the host and deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the haunt. A haunt slain in such a manner cannot rejuvenate and is permanently destroyed.

AAA	KEY:Hawanar ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HawanarRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:

AAA	KEY:HellMoth ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HellMothRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Engulf (Ex) If a hell moth grapples an opponent it can wrap a Medium or smaller creature in its wings and body and automatically deal bite damage in each round it maintains the grapple. Attacks that hit an engulfing hell moth deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.

AAA	KEY:HellMoth ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HellMothRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Immolation (Su) A hell moth that has engulfed an opponent can detonate its body in a blast of hellish fire that deals 6d10 points of fire damage to itself and the engulfed opponent (no save). (Reduce the damage dealt to the hell moth by its fire resistance.) A hell moth can immolate itself once every 3 hours (providing it survives the immolation).  Creatures within 10 feet of the hell moth when it uses this ability must succeed on a DC 17 Reflex save or take 1d8 points of fire damage as clothes and combustibles ignite. The damage continues for another 1d4+4 rounds after the hell moth uses this ability or until the fire is extinguished. The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:HellstokerDevil ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HellstokerDevilRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Bellows (Ex) A hellstoker can use its burning hands to light its bellows as a standard action. This allows the hellstoker to fire a jet of flame from its bellows in a line to a range of 30 feet, once per round as a standard action. It must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit a foe. A creature hit by the fire takes 1d8 points of fire damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or catch on fire.

AAA	KEY:HellstokerDevil ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HellstokerDevilRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Fiery Body (Ex) The oil coating a hellstoker's body is highly flammable. As such, a hellstoker hit with a fire effect bursts into flames. This deals no damage to the hellstoker, and deals 1d6 points of fire damage to any creature touching or grappling the hellstoker. The fire burns for 10 rounds before extinguishing. This does not damage the hellstoker's oily hide; therefore, it still retains its racial bonus to Escape Artist checks (see oily hide below), and it can be caught on fire again.

AAA	KEY:HellstokerDevil ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HellstokerDevilRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Oily Hide (Ex) Hellstokers do not secrete oil naturally, but their constant contact with it leaves them coated with a thick layer of the substance at all times. This grants hellstokers a +10 racial bonus to Escape Artist checks (included in the statistics block). The oil cannot be washed off or removed.  Additionally, if a hellstoker is hit with a fire effect, it bursts into flames. See the hellstoker's fiery body above for details.

Animated Host (Su) Once a victim trapped within an iron maiden has died, it reanimates as a zombie in the next round (as if by an animate dead spell). It cannot escape, however, and serves only to fuel the iron maiden and provide it with skills and abilities. While it is trapped, the zombie cannot be attacked, damaged, turned, rebuked, or commanded, and it doesn't suffer any damage from the bladed lid. If the lid of the golem is somehow forced open, the zombie has the normal abilities of a Medium zombie (as detailed in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary). The victim of an iron maiden golem must be alive when it is placed inside and the lid is closed or the golem's animate host ability fails.

AAA	KEY:IronMaidenGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:IronMaidenGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Bladed Lid (Ex) A living creature inside an iron maiden when the lid is closed is pierced by twenty dagger-like blades, dealing a total of 50 points of piercing damage each round. The lid automatically seals with an arcane lock spell with a caster level equal to that of the iron maiden golem's creator (14th level usually). The lid can be forced open with a successful Strength check (DC 34) or by casting dispel magic. The knock spell has no effect on the lid.

AAA	KEY:IronMaidenGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:IronMaidenGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Magic (Ex) An iron maiden golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows an iron maiden golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw.  A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the iron maiden golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.

AAA	KEY:IronMaidenGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:IronMaidenGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Steal Essence (Su) An iron maiden golem that has created a host using its animate host ability (see above) gains 10 temporary hit points, uses its own base attack bonus or the host's (whichever is higher), and can make normal use of the victim's skills, feats, and non-magical class abilities.  The golem must substitute its own ability scores when determining its total skill bonuses; therefore it cannot use skills requiring Constitution or Intelligence, and since it cannot speak, many Charisma skills are severely limited. Likewise, the iron maiden golem must meet the requirements for any feat in order to make use of that feat (thus feats such as Dodge and Combat Expertise are unavailable to the golem). An iron maiden cannot use any divine spells or divinely granted special abilities, since the host within is no longer able to receive such abilities from her deity. An iron maiden likewise cannot use any arcane spells as its inherent magic immunity disrupts any attempt to do so.

AAA	KEY:IronMaidenGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:IronMaidenGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

Daze (Ex) Any creature hit by a jack-in-iron's melee attack must succeed on a DC 36 Fortitude save or be dazed 1d2 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based and is a function of the jack-in-irons not its weapon(s).

AAA	KEY:JackInIronsGiant ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:JackInIronsGiantRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Pound (Ex) A jack-in-irons that makes a successful grapple check against a foe two or more sizes smaller than itself can smash the opponent into the ground, walls, nearby trees, or other solid objects as a standard action. This deals 2d6+19 points of bludgeoning damage to the victim. In addition, the opponent must succeed on a DC 36 Fortitude save or be stunned for one round. A jack-in-irons can perform this action once per round as long as it maintains the grapple. The save DC is Strength-based.

Jade Colossus

AAA	KEY:JadeColossus ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:JadeColossusRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a jade colossus can spray a blast of green energy in either a 60-foot cone or a 120-foot line. A creature in the affected area takes 15d6 points of damage, Reflex half DC 26. A creature slain as the result of this breath weapon transforms into jade. The save DC is Constitution-based. A creature turned to jade has Hardness 6, hp 40. This effect can be reversed by casting stone to flesh, wish, or miracle. The victim remains dead, but can then be raised or resurrected normally.

AAA	KEY:JadeColossus ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:JadeColossusRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A jade colossus is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A disintegrate spell slows a jade colossus (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds, with no saving throw.  A shatter spell deals 3d12 points of damage to a jade colossus, with no saving throw.  A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the jade colossus and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A jade colossus gets no saving throw against fire effects.

AAA	KEY:JadeColossus ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:JadeColossusRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Light Reflection (Ex) The angles and makeup of the jade colossus allows it to reflect any light-based attacks or effects (it cannot reflect natural sunlight however). Reflected light acts as an emanation (lasting 1 round) that blinds all creatures within 40 feet. A creature can attempt a Reflex save DC 26 to avoid being blinded. If the save fails, the creature is blinded for 2d4 rounds (as the blindness spell); creatures that successfully save are instead dazzled for a like amount of time. Undead and similar creatures to whom sunlight is harmful to take 6d6 points of damage (a successful Reflex save DC 26 halves the damage).



Ruby Star of Law

Sages speak of a jade colossus located in the City of Brass that has the ruby star of law (a gem of inestimable value) embedded in its forehead. The Jade Guardian (as it is known in the City) is a
CR:18 advanced jade colossus with the following additional ability.

AAA	KEY:JadeColossus ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:JadeColossusRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Energy Ray (Su) Once per round as a swift action, the Jade Guardian can fire a ray to a range of 200 feet (requires a successful ranged touch attack to hit). Genies hit by this ray must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 26) or take 6d4 points of Constitution damage. On a successful save, the genie takes onehalf damage. Other creatures are affected as follows: Lawful creatures are slowed (as by the slow spell) for 1d4 rounds (no save). Non-lawful creatures take 6d6 points of force damage (no save) and are stunned for 1d4 rounds (DC 26 Fortitude save negates). Should the ruby star of law ever be claimed as a magic item, treat it as a minor artifact that allows use of the energy ray ability indicated above, save that it requires a standard action to activate.

A metal or wooden weapon that strikes Jubilex also dissolves immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 38 Reflex save. Jubilex's acidic touch deals 38 points of damage per round to wooden or metal objects, but he must remain in contact with the object for 1 full round to deal this damage.

AAA	KEY:Kelpie ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KelpieRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Charm (Su) Once per day, a kelpie can produce an effect identical to the charm monster spell (caster level 9th). The target can make a DC 17 Will save to avoid the effects. If the save fails, the victim believes the kelpie to be a very beautiful and attractive creature, and attempts to move as quickly as possible toward the kelpie.  The kelpie can automatically grapple a charmed foe and attempts to drown the victim. A charmed foe does not resist the kelpie's embrace, and the drowning attempt does not allow an additional save. Female creatures are immune to the kelpie's charm ability; only males can be affected. The charm is negated if the victim dies, the kelpie dies, or dispel magic, greater dispelling, miracle, or wish is cast on the victim. If the save is successful, the target cannot be affected by that kelpie's charm or charm touch for 24 hours.  The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

Earth Glide (Ex) A khargra can glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth, including metal, as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing khargra flings the khargra back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save.

AAA	KEY:Khargra ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KhargraRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Rend Armor (Ex) If a khargra hits with a bite attack, it deals normal bite damage and pulls apart any metal armor worn by its foe. This attack deals 2d8+2 points of damage to the opponent's armor. Creatures wearing no armor or non-metal armor are unaffected by this special attack (though they still take normal bite damage). Armor reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed and devoured by the khargra.  Damaged armor gains the broken condition.

AAA	KEY:Khargra ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KhargraRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Sundering Bite (Ex) A khargra can making a sunder attempt with its bite attack against an opponent's weapon or shield without provoking attacks of opportunity. Resolve this using the normal rules for a sunder attempt. If the khargra succeeds on its CMB roll, it deals 2d8+2 points of damage to the weapon or shield. Note, against a khargra, a weapon or shield's hardness is only one-half as effective as normal. This means that a light steel shield, for example, is considered to have a hardness of 5 rather than 10 against a khargra's sunder attack. A weapon or shield reduced to 0 or less hit points is destroyed and half of it is swallowed by the khargra.  It only uses this special attack against metal weapons and shields. Damaged armor and weapons gain the broken condition.

The time it takes to weave enough hair to entangle one foe is dependent on the size of the creature as follows: Size | Time || Up to Tiny | 1 round || Small or Medium | 2 rounds || Large | 3 rounds || A korred cannot entangle an opponent of greater than Large size. This ability otherwise is similar to the animate rope spell (caster level 15th)

AAA	KEY:LanternGoat ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:LanternGoatRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Soul Capture (Su) Any living creature reduced to below 0 hit points while within 60 feet of a lantern goat must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or have its soul drawn into the lantern goat's lantern. The DC increases by +1 for every hit point the character is below 0 (e.g., a character at -3 hit points must save at DC 20). Once captured, the lantern goat slowly digests the creature's soul over a period of 1 hour, using it to fuel its dark energies. A creature slain in this manner can only be returned to life by a resurrection, true resurrection, wish, or miracle. Raise dead has no effect on such a slain creature. If the lantern goat is slain and the lantern destroyed, the soul is released back to the body if still living. The lantern cannot be destroyed or removed until the lantern goat is destroyed.

AAA	KEY:LavaWeird ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:LavaWeirdRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Control Elemental (Ex) Lava weirds can attempt to command any outsider with the "Earth," "Elemental," or "Fire" subtype that is within 50 feet. The Will save to avoid control has a DC of 21. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.  This effect is similar to the dominate monster spell. The elemental receives a Will save to avoid being commanded. If the save succeeds, that elemental is immune to the control elemental ability of that lava weird for one day. If the save fails, the elemental falls under the control of the lava weird and obeys it to the best of its ability until either it or the weird dies. There is no limit to the number of HD of elementals a lava weird can control using this ability. The range is unlimited though both the lava weird and the elemental must be on the same plane of existence; otherwise, the weird loses control of the elemental. Lava weirds cannot control other lava weirds using this ability.

AAA	KEY:LavaWeird ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:LavaWeirdRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Fire (Ex) Lava weirds are living creatures of elemental magma; any successful melee hit deals fire damage and the victim must make a successful Reflex save (DC 16) or catch on fire (see Catching on Fire in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook). The save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures attacking a lava weird unarmed or with natural weapons take fire damage and must make a successful Reflex save to avoid catching on fire just as if the lava weird had hit with its attack.

AAA	KEY:LavaWeird ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:LavaWeirdRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Drown (Ex) If a lava weird pins a grabbed foe, it fully immerses its victim in its lava pool. A victim completely immersed takes fire damage (see Lava Pool below) and must hold its breath or drown. The victim can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to twice its Constitution score. After that, the victim must make a successful Constitution check (DC 10, +1 per previous check) each round to continue holding its breath. If the victim fails a check, it drowns. In the first round, the victim falls unconscious (0 hp). In the next round, the creature is dying (-1 hp), and in the third round the victim drowns.  Lava Pool: A lava weird's pool is a bubbling, churning, morass of molten rock mixed with elemental fire. Flammable materials that contact the lava pool automatically catch fire on the round contact is made. Creatures touching the pool take 2d8 points of fire damage per round of contact. Damage from the lava pool continues for 1d3 rounds after contact ceases, but this extra damage is only half of that dealt during contact (1d8 points of damage). Creatures immune to fire are unaffected by the lava weird's pool and take no damage, though they can still drown if completely immersed.

AAA	KEY:LichShade ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:LichShadeRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Spell Leech (Su) Whenever a spellcaster within 50 feet of a lich shade casts a spell, the spellcaster must make a DC 20 Will save or the spell is lost, as if it were counterspelled. The lost spell's energy is transferred to the lich shade, who can use the magical energy in one of the following three ways. A lich shade can only store the energy of one spell at a time.  Cast: A lich shade can cast the spell on his turn at caster level 11th. When casting spells in this manner, he ignores the spell's material component requirements, but not its focus requirements.  Eldritch Bolt: A lich shade can release the spell as an eldritch bolt of pure magic energy as a standard action (range 50 ft., ranged touch +12, 1d6 damage per 2 levels of the spell used to create it).

If the save fails, the elemental falls under the control of the lightning weird and obeys it to the best of its ability until either it or the lightning weird dies. There is no limit to the number of HD of elementals a lightning weird can control using this ability. The range is unlimited though both the lightning weird and the elemental must be on the same plane of existence; otherwise, the lightning weird loses control of the elemental. Lightning weirds cannot control other lightning weirds using this ability.

AAA	KEY:LightningWeird ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:LightningWeirdRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Electricity (Ex) Lightning weirds are living creatures of elemental lightning; any successful melee hit deals electricity damage. Creatures attacking a lightning weird unarmed or with natural weapons are subject to electricity damage.  Lightning Pool: A lightning weird's pool is a crackling, dancing, arcing, ball of electricity. Creatures touching the pool take 2d8 points of electricity damage per round of contact.

AAA	KEY:Livestone ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:LivestoneRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Solidify (Ex) A livestone can solidify all or part of itself into a material with the hardness and consistency of solid rock. A solidified part of a livestone has a hardness of 8 and a break DC of 50. A livestone can effect the solidification as a free action. An opponent attacking a livestone must succeed on a DC 19 Reflex save each time his attack hits. If the save is failed, the livestone actually solidifies the portion of its body at the instant it was hit, thus applying its hardness rating of 8 to any damage it takes.

The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:Lucifer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:LuciferRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialAttack	DESC:
Curse () Any creature meeting Lucifer's gaze must succeed at a Will save or be affected as if by a double-strength bestow curse spell (-12 to one ability score or -6 to two ability scores; or -8 enhancement penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks; or each turn the target has a 25% chance to act normally, otherwise he takes no action; Lucifer chooses the curse when he uses this special attack).

AAA	KEY:Lucifer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:LuciferRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:
Rod of Infernus Lucifer's black iron rod functions as a Huge +6 trident that he can wield without penalty. It has the following abilities ()

Annihilation Ray: Once per round, and no more than five times per day, the rod
can fire a ray to a range of 60 feet. A creature struck by this ray must
succeed on a DC 40 Fortitude save or be annihilated instantly-not even a trace
of dust is left behind. No form of mortal magic can restore life to a creature
annihilated by this ray. Lucifer or a deity can restore the annihilated
creature to life using magic.

Rod of Rulership: The rod has all of the abilities and powers of a rod of
rulership.

Trap the Soul: Once per round, and no more than three times per day, the rod
can fire a ray of hellish-red energy to a range of 60 feet that functions as a
trap the soul spell (CL 20th). A target can make a DC 40 Will save to resist
the effects. If failed, the victim's soul vanishes into Lucifer's rod. Up to
10 such souls can be held in the rod at one time. A trapped soul may be freed
by grasping the rod and speaking a command word.

Any non-devil that touches the rod takes 10d8 points of electricity damage per
round of contact (no save) and gains two negative levels each round it touches
the rod. The Fortitude save to remove a negative level has a DC of 40 and can
result in actual level loss on a failed save. The negative levels cannot be
overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the rod is wielded.
Any goodaligned creature that touches the rod takes 3d6 points of Constitution
drain each round it touches the rod (DC 40 Fortitude save for half).

Hell's Redoubt () Hell's Redoubt is Lucifer's Large suit of +5 heavy
fortification banded mail that has no armor check penalty, speed penalty, and
no chance for arcane spell failure. It was personally crafted for him the
hands of Cheshimiboth, Armorer of the Nine Hells, just prior to the Great
Uprising. To reward this unique devil's genius for crafting, Lucifer had him
murdered in the first moments of the Uprising to prevent him from ever
revealing any vulnerability in the armor he fashioned or ever again crafting
its equal. In addition to its fortification qualities, three times per day,
Lucifer can cause the fires of Hell to spring forth in a 30-foot radius spread
around him (the spread remains stationary once called forth). These fires last
for 3 rounds and deal 10d6 points of fire damage per round (DC 40 Reflex save
for half) and ignore all fire resistance and fire immunity. Only the wearer of
the armor is immune to their effects. Those slain by these fires are
completely destroyed (including their equipment) and cannot be returned to
life through anything short of divine intervention.  Hell's Redoubt functions
as +1 banded mail and bestows five negative levels for as long as it is worn
if worn by anyone other than Lucifer unless the wearer defeats Asmodeus and
gains the Throne of Hell. At that point it resumes its ordinary function.
Anyone wearing the armor is filled with the overwhelming urge to attempt to do
that very thing no matter the cost. The negative levels disappear if the armor
is removed.

A magical effect that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A magnesium golem gets no saving throw against fire effects.

AAA	KEY:MagnesiumSpirit ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagnesiumSpiritRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Soul Portal (Su) This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 8th), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the magnesium spirit must try move into the target's space; moving into the target's space to use this ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 17 Will save. If the save fails, the magnesium spirit vanishes into the target's body. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus from the creature's Ability Focus feat.  A magnesium spirit that has possessed an opponent's body deals a negative level to the host each round (see its energy drain attack above). When the host drops below 1st level, both it and the magnesium spirit vanish in a flash of white light as the spirit completes the ritual needed to return it to its plane of origin. Neither is ever seen again.  Each round, as a standard action, while the magnesium spirit inhabits its body, the host can attempt to eject the creature by making an opposed Wisdom check against the magnesium spirit's Wisdom check. If successful, the magnesium spirit is ejected and cannot use its soul portal ability against that creature again for 1 hour.  A magnesium spirit can be damaged by holy water even while merged with its host. Holy water deals 2d4 points of damage per vial to the creature.

All creatures (other than marble snakes) with the area must succeed on a DC 11 Will save or become entranced.  This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same marble snake's whistle for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.  An entranced victim walks toward the marble snake, taking the most direct route available. If the path leads into a dangerous area, that creature gets a second saving throw. The effect continues for as long as the marble snake whistles and for 1 round thereafter. An entranced victim is effectively dazed (cannot attack, but can defend). If an entranced opponent is attacked, the effect is immediately broken. A bard's countersong ability allows the entranced creature to attempt a new Will save.

Mature Helix Moth

AAA	KEY:MatureHelixMoth ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MatureHelixMothRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Drone (Ex) The rapid beating of the helix moth's wings creates a droning sound that is audible up to 60 feet away. This droning clouds the minds of all creatures within 30 feet that hear it except other helix moths. A successful DC 21 Will save negates the effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  On a failed save, a creature suffers a -4 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, checks and saves for 1 minute. After this time, a new save can be attempted (same DC) if the helix moth's droning can still be heard and the creature is within range. If this save fails, the creature remains affected for another one minute. This continues every minute until a successful save is made or the combat ends. A creature that makes a successful Will save is unaffected by the droning of that helix moth for one day. The droning is a free action so long as the helix moth is airborne. On the ground, it may beat its wings as a move action with the effects as above.

AAA	KEY:Mawler ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MawlerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Mimic Shape (Ex) A mawler can assume the general shape of any object that is roughly Tiny sized. A mawler's body is fleshy and pliable, but it can alter the rigidity of its body to resemble metal, wood, and even stone. Most mawlers have found that taking on the shape of articles of clothing provides the most ready meals. The ruse can be detected by a Perception check opposed by the mawler's Disguise skill.

AAA	KEY:Mawler ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MawlerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Vorpal Bite (Ex) A mawler that scores a critical hit with its bite attack while being worn severs the extremity that was inside it at the time. For example, a mawler being worn as a boot that scores a critical hit, severs the victim's leg. A mawler can only use its vorpal bite while being worn.  A creature that loses a limb suffers a -4 penalty to skill checks that require the use of two limbs. For example, a victim that loses a hand or arm suffers a -4 penalty to Climb checks, Disable Device checks, and so forth. Additionally, a creature that loses its primary weapon-wielding arm or hand suffers a -6 penalty when wielding a weapon in its offhand. A creature with the Two-Weapon Fighting feat that loses its primary arm or hand ignores the penalty for wielding a weapon in its offhand.  If the victim loses a foot or leg, the penalty applies to Acrobatics checks and the like. Additionally, the creature's speed is reduced to one-quarter. If the severed extremity happens to be the head, the victim dies immediately (unless it can live without its head).

Bay (Su) A moon dog can produce one of the following effects when it howls or barks. Each effect functions as the spell of the same name (caster level 12th). The save DCs are Charisma-based.  Fear: All evil creatures within 80 feet must make a successful Will save or be affected as by a fear spell. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. If the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected by the fear effect of that moon dog's bay for 24 hours.  Dispel Evil: This effect works like the spell, and affects one evil extraplanar creature within 80 feet.

Mortuary Cyclone

AAA	KEY:MortuaryCyclone ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MortuaryCycloneRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Create Spawn (Su) Any living creature slain by a mortuary cyclone's necrocone attack or energy drain attack becomes an undead creature in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are under the command of the mortuary cyclone that created them and remain enslaved until its destruction. See the sidebar for the type of undead creatures a mortuary cyclone can spawn.

AAA	KEY:MortuaryCyclone ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MortuaryCycloneRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Desecrating Aura (Su) A mortuary cyclone emanates an aura of desecration within a 50-foot radius centered on its body.  This functions as a desecrate spell (caster level 18th) as if the mortuary cyclone where a permanent fixture dedicated to its own deity. Clerics in the area take a -6 profane penalty on turning checks, undead within the area gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves, and undead created within the area have +2 hit points per HD. Further, anyone casting animate dead within 50 feet of a mortuary cyclone creates as many as double the normal amount of undead (4 HD per caster level instead of 2 HD per caster level).  A consecrate spell cast on a mortuary cyclone by a caster of 18th level or higher nullifies its desecrating aura for 1 minute per caster level.

AAA	KEY:MortuaryCyclone ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MortuaryCycloneRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Necrocone (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a mortuary cyclone can blast forth a mass of bone fragments, debris and negative energy in a 30-foot cone. Creatures caught in the cone take 6d6 points of damage. Half this damage is piercing damage, but the other half is from negative energy and is not subject to resistance or immunity (unless the opponent is resistant or immune to negative energy effects). An affected creature that succeeds on a DC 27 Reflex save reduces the piercing damage by half. Undead within the area of a necrocone heal a number of hit points equal to the amount of negative energy damage (3d6) the attack would otherwise deal. An undead creature cannot gain temporary or bonus hit points from a mortuary cyclone's necrocone. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:MortuaryCyclone ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MortuaryCycloneRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Unholy Grace (Su) A mortuary cyclone adds its Charisma modifier as a bonus on its saving throws and as a profane bonus to its Armor Class. (The statistics block already reflects these bonuses.)

Mouse Lord

AAA	KEY:MouseLord ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MouseLordRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Change Shape (Su) The Mouse Lord can assume the shape of a human as a standard action. In human form, the Mouse Lord cannot use her natural weapons or disease special attack but can wield weapons and wear armor. Unlike the normal change shape ability, the Mouse Lord retains her movement modes (and speeds) in human form.

AAA	KEY:MouseLord ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MouseLordRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Disease (Ex) Black fever-bite, save Fort DC 21; onset 1 day; frequency 1 day; damage 1d4 Dex, 1d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based. The Mouse Lord can suppress her ability to cause disease (as a free action) if she so wishes.

AAA	KEY:MouseLord ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MouseLordRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Immortality (Su) The Mouse Lord is effectively immortal and nearly impossible to slay. When slain, the Mouse Lord's soul reforms on the Astral Plane. Within one week, it inhabits another mouse or rat on the Material Plane and the Mouse Lord reforms. No form of magic (such as magic that would contain or trap her soul) prevents this. To permanently kill the Mouse Lord, one must destroy every mouse and rat in existence (so her soul has no creature to inhabit).

Blinding Spray (Ex) By filling its mouth with muddy water, a muckdweller can fire a stream of muddy water in a 10-foot line. A creature hit must succeed on a DC 10 Reflex save or be blinded for 1d2 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. A muckdweller can take a move action to refill its mouth with muddy water so it can use its spray again.

-----------------------------------------------

Mudbog

AAA	KEY:Mudbog ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MudbogRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Acid (Ex) A mudbog secretes a digestive acid that quickly dissolves organic material, but not metal or stone. Any melee hit deals 1d6 points of acid damage. Armor or clothing dissolves and becomes useless immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 17 Reflex save. A wooden weapon that strikes a mudbog dissolves immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 17 Reflex save. The mudbog's acidic touch deals 17 points of acid damage per round to wooden objects, but the ooze must remain in contact with the object for 1 full round to deal this damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:Mudbog ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MudbogRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Camouflage (Ex) The consistency and coloration of a mudbog makes it difficult to discern from a normal patch of mud. Any creature within 10 feet of a mudbog must make a DC 20 Perception or Survival check to determine the actual nature of the creature.

AAA	KEY:Mudbog ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MudbogRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Engulf (Ex) A Medium or smaller opponent that walks into a mudbog is automatically grappled and takes 1d6 acid damage each round the mudbog maintains the hold.  Engulfed creatures are considered to be grappled and are trapped within the mudbog's body. This ability otherwise functions as swallow whole, save that a creature that cut its way out of a mudbog leaves no hole in the protoplas creature's body.

Mudman

AAA	KEY:Mudman ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MudmanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Engulf (Su) Once per minute as a standard action, a mudman can hurl itself at any creature of its size or smaller within 10 feet. If it succeeds on a ranged touch attack, the mudman immediately makes a CMB check to grapple the target (this does not provoke an attack of opportunity) with a +4 racial bonus. If the mudman fails to establish a hold, it drops into an adjacent square and is staggered for 1 round. If the mudman establishes a hold, it flows over its opponent, covering the creature with its muddy body-it can attempt a new CMB check to maintain the "hold" on the creature each round that follows as a free action. The creature is effectively blinded and must either hold its breath or suffocate as long as the mudman retains its hold. Each round the mudman maintains its hold, it deals 1d4+3 points of damage as it crushes and constricts its victims.

AAA	KEY:Mudman ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MudmanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Magic Vulnerability (Ex) Mudmen are particularly susceptible to dispel magic, as this spell disrupts the magical energies in their bodies. A mudman subjected to dispel magic takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (Fortitude save for half damage). Transmute mud to rock deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to any mudmen caught in the area of effect and leaves them staggered until they can find a new mud pool. Other, similar spells may have similar effects.

AAA	KEY:Mudman ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MudmanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Mud Bomb (Su) A mudman can hurl globs of its muddy body mixed with its surrounding mud-this attack has a range increment of 10 feet. If one of these mud bombs hits a target, it quickly grows semi-solid and tenacious, causing 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. If the cumulative Dexterity damage from mud bombs ever equals the target's actual Dexterity score, the target remains conscious but is held immobile and cannot take any physical action (although see below) until the mud is removed or the target breaks free. Spell-like abilities or spells with only verbal components may be used if the trapped creature can make a DC 20 concentration check. It's a DC 20 Strength check (made as a full-round action) to pry accumulated mud off and remove all Dexterity damage caused by the attack-a creature that is held immobile can break free with a DC 25 Strength check made as a full-round action (this is the only physical action the creature can attempt while encased in mud). The mud dries and crumbles to dust in 15 minutes, or in 1d3 rounds if a large amount of water (such as results from a casting of create water) is used to wash it away.

AAA	KEY:Mudman ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MudmanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Mud Pool (Su) A mudman cannot leave the bounds of the mud pool it dwells in, although these mud pools may be of any size. A mudman's tremorsense extends throughout the entire mud pool, and it gains a +16 bonus on Stealth checks when hiding in a mud pool. A mudman forced out of its mud pool is staggered.

Mummy Golem

AAA	KEY:MummyGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MummyGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Strangulation (Ex) As a standard action a mummy golem can attempt to wrap bandages from its body around a grappled foe's throat. The mummy golem makes a grapple check. If the mummy golem wins the check, it slips seve bandages around the foe's throat deals 1d4 points of strangulation damage in addition to constriction damage. The bandages can come from anywhere on its body, not just its arm or hand. Therefore, a mummy golem can continue to use its slam attacks, constriction, and strangulation attack against other foes. A Medium mummy golem can strangle a maximum of 4 opponents at one time using this ability. A Large mummy golem can strangle a maximum of 6 opponents at one time using this ability. A mummy golem is not considered grappled while it is strangling an opponent, and can move and attack normally, but it cannot move more than 10 feet away from an opponent while strangling it.

Mummy of the Deep

AAA	KEY:MummyoftheDeep ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MummyoftheDeepRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:

AAA	KEY:MummyoftheDeep ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MummyoftheDeepRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Curse of the Deep (Su) On a successful grapple check against a creature up to its size, a mummy of the deep presses its lips against an opponent's and regurgitates sea water into the opponent's lungs.  Each round thereafter, for the next 10 rounds, the victim must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of damage that round. Three consecutive successful saves means the character has coughed up enough water to shake the effects of this attack and takes no further damage. An affected creature can take no actions other than to defend itself in any round it takes damage from this ability. At 0 or less hit points, the victim falls unconscious. In the next round, he drowns. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Holding one's breath does not prevent drowning (water is already in the lungs). A remove curse, heal spell, or successful DC 20 Heal check halts the damage if applied before the creature reaches 0 or less hit points.

AAA	KEY:MummyoftheDeep ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MummyoftheDeepRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Despair (Su) At the mere sight of a mummy of the deep, the viewer must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds.

Murder-Born

AAA	KEY:MurderBorn ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MurderBornRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Despondent Wail (Su) As a standard action, a murder-born can unleash a child-like wail. Any living creature within 60 feet that hears the wail must make a successful DC 16 Will save or be overcome with supernatural feelings of hopelessness. A powerful curse falls upon the victim and they become so despondent that they need to make a successful DC 16 Concentration check in order to motivate themselves enough to make an attack or cast spell. The curse is permanent, though a remove curse or break enchantment (both requiring a successful caster level check against DC 18) or a limited wish, wish, or miracle can remove the effects of curse. The save DC is Charisma-based. Whether or not the save is successful, an individual cannot be affected by a murderborn's despondent wail for the next 24 hours.

AAA	KEY:MurderBorn ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MurderBornRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:

AAA	KEY:NabasuDemon ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:NabasuDemonRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Death Gaze (Su) Once per day per growth point (minimum 1/day for a demonling, 10/day for a mature nabasu), a nabasu can use its death gaze for a full round. Living creatures within 20 feet must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain a negative level. A humanoid slain in this manner transforms into a ghoul in 1d4 rounds under the control of the nabasu that created it. The save DC is Charisma-based. If the nabasu dies, any ghouls under its control become free-willed.

It gains a bonus equal to its growth point total on attack rolls, CMB rolls, saving throws, caster level checks, and skill checks. Its maximum hit points increase by 10 for each growth point it gains and its caster level increases by 1. For every 2 growth points, its natural armor bonus, SR, and CR increases by +1. Each time it gains a growth point, the nabasu demonling makes a DC 30 caster level check-success indicates it becomes a mature nabasu. At 10 growth points, a demonling automatically becomes a mature nabasu.

Negative Energy Elemental

AAA	KEY:NegativeEnergyElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:NegativeEnergyElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Death Throes (Su) A negative energy elemental that is killed explodes in a flash of swirling negative energy that affects all within the area (the radius for its death throes ability is the same as the radius for its negative energy aura). Living creatures within the area take 1d8 points of negative energy damage per two HD of the elemental. Negative energy based creatures and undead gain hit points equal to the amount of damage the death throes would have otherwise dealt. (The rules for temporary hit points and doubling hit points as detailed under the elemental's negative energy apply here.) A successful Reflex DC (save DC same as the elemental's negative energy save DC) reduces the damage by half.

AAA	KEY:NegativeEnergyElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:NegativeEnergyElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Negative Energy (Ex) A negative energy elemental infuses a target hit by its slam attack with negative energy. This deals extra damage to a living target (as listed in the statistics block) but heals undead (and other negative energy based creatures) by the same amount. Undead (and other negative	energy based creatures) can be healed above their normal hit point total, gaining extra hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear 1 minute later. Creatures healed to twice their normal hit points (that is, a creature whose hit points are effectively doubled) must succeed on a Fortitude save or explode in a burst of negative energy. The save DC is Constitution based. See the table below for each negative energy elemental's save DC. Negative energy (such as an inflict spell or negative energy channeling) can heal negative energy elementals.

AAA	KEY:NegativeEnergyElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:NegativeEnergyElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Negative Energy Aura (Su) A negative energy elemental radiates an aura of pure negative energy around it. (See the table for the area each elemental affects.) Within a negative energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use negative energy, such as negative energy channeling or the Command Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels higher. Additionally, spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy are maximized (as if the Maximize Spell metamagic feat had been used on them, but the spells don't require higher-level slots). Spells and spell-like abilities that are already maximized are unaffected by this benefit. This aura does not affect the negative energy channeling ability of the negative energy elemental using it, and its effects do not stack with those of other negative energy elementals.  Within a negative energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use positive energy, such as positive energy channeling or the Turn Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels lower. Spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy, including cure spells, require the caster to succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell). If the check fails, the spell does not function but is still lost as a prepared spell or spell slot.  If the check succeeds, the spell functions normally.

AAA	KEY:NegativeEnergyElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:NegativeEnergyElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Negative Energy Channeling (Su) A Large or larger negative energy elemental can channel negative energy as a cleric whose level equals the elemental's Hit Dice. The Will save DC includes a +2 racial bonus.

Beguiling Aura (Su) Any creature sexually attracted to women runs the risk of being beguiled by a nereid if it looks upon her beauty from a distance of 30 feet or less. If the creature fails a DC 25 Will save, it is immediately fascinated. A nereid may use her suggestion spell-like ability at will against creatures that are fascinated by her beguiling aura. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:Nereid ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:NereidRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Drowning Kiss (Su) A nereid can flood the lungs of a willing, helpless, or fascinated creature by touching it (traditionally by kissing the creature on the lips). If the target cannot breathe water, it cannot hold its breath and immediately begins to drown. On its turn, the target can attempt a DC 23 Fortitude save to cough up this water; otherwise it falls unconscious at 0 hp. On the next round, the target must save again or drop to -1 hit points and be dying; on the third round it must save again or die (see page 445 of the Pathfinder Core Rulebook). The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:Poltergeist ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PoltergeistRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Rejuvenation (Su) Like ghosts, it's difficult to destroy a poltergeist through simple combat: the "destroyed" spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Unlike ghosts, powerful spells such as dispel evil usually are effective. Short of that, however, the only way to permanently destroy a poltergeist is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different poltergeist or group of poltergeists by the GM.

AAA	KEY:Poltergeist ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PoltergeistRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Telekinesis (Su) A poltergeist can create a telekinetic effect to hurl one object or creature within 10 feet to a distance of 60 feet (no range increment).

A creature targeted by this ability can make a DC 13 Will save to avoid being hurled by the poltergeist. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Positive Energy Elemental

Blinding Flash (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a positive energy elemental of at least Medium size can release a burst of pure energy in a 10-foot radius. Creatures viewing this burst must succeed on a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d10 rounds. See the table below for the save DC for each positive energy elemental's blinding flash. The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:PositiveEnergyElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PositiveEnergyElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Death Throes (Su) A positive energy elemental that is killed explodes in a flash of blinding positive energy that affects all within the area (the radius for its death throes ability is the same as the radius for its positive energy aura). Undead and negative energy based creatures within the area take 1d8 points of positive energy damage per two HD of the elemental. Positive energy based creatures (including creatures from the Material Plane) gain hit points equal to the amount of damage the death throes would have otherwise dealt. (The rules for temporary hit points and doubling hit points as detailed under the elemental's positive energy apply here.) A successful Reflex DC (save DC same as the elemental's positive energy save DC) reduces the damage by half.  All creatures in the area must succeed on a Fortitude save (same DC as the elemental's positive energy save DC) or be blinded for 1d10 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:PositiveEnergyElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PositiveEnergyElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Positive Energy (Ex) A positive energy elemental infuses a target hit by its slam attack with positive energy. This dealse xtra damage to an undead or negative energy based target (as listed in the statistics block) but heals positive energy based creatures (including creatures from the Material Plane) by the same amount. Such creatures can be healed above their normal hit point total, gaining extra hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear 1 minute later.  Creatures healed to twice their normal hit points (that is, a creature whose hit points are effectively doubled) must succeed on a Fortitude save or explode in a burst of positive energy. The save DC is Constitution-based. See the table below for each positive energy elemental's save DC.  Positive energy (such as a cure spell or positive energy channeling) can heal positive energy elementals.

AAA	KEY:PositiveEnergyElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PositiveEnergyElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Positive Energy Aura (Su) A positive energy elemental radiates an aura of pure positive energy around it. (See the table for the area each elemental affects.) Within a positive energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use positive energy, such as positive energy channeling or the Turn Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels higher. Additionally, spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy are maximized (as if the Maximize Spell metamagic feat had been used on them, but the spells don't require higher-level slots).  Spells and spell-like abilities that are already maximized are unaffected by this benefit. This aura does not affect the positvi e energy channeling ability of the positive energy elemental using it, and its effects do not stack with those of other positive energy elementals.  Within a positive energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use negative energy, such as negative energy channeling or the Command Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels lower. Spells and spell-like abilities that use negatvie energy, including inflict spells, require the caster to succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell). If the check fails, the spell does not function but is still lost as a prepared spell or spell slot. If the check succeeds, the spell functions normally.

AAA	KEY:PositiveEnergyElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PositiveEnergyElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:

Condemn (Su) Once per day, as a melee touch attack, a proscriber can sever the connection between a divine caster and his or her deity. The target can attempt a DC 22 Will save (to negate the effects. If the save fails, the divine caster loses the ability to cast divine spells, turn or rebuke undead, smite good or evil, and loses the use of other divine-based spell, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. Even if the save succeeds, the divine caster touched takes 10d6 points of damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Additionally, one that fails its save resists all beneficial divine spells (such as heal, or any cure spell) and effects cast on him or her. A creature attempting to cast a beneficial divine spell on a condemned creature must make a successful DC 20 caster level check or the spell has no effect on the condemned creature.  The effects of this ability are permanent but can be removed by the casting of a remove curse spell followed by an atonement spell. The one casting the remove curse and atonement spells must be a divine caster who worships the same god as the condemned and who is of a class level equal to or higher than the condemned.

Sand Giant

AAA	KEY:SandGiant ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SandGiantRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Fist of Sand (Su) Once per day as a move action, a sand giant can form a volume of sand within 40 feet into the shape of a 20-foot long arm that ends in a clenched fist. The arm is Huge and has a space of 15 ft. and a reach of 20 ft. The arm and fist cannot move from the location where it was created.  The sand giant can order the arm to attack a target as a move action. Once given a target, the arm automatically attacks that target on the giant's turn. The arm remains for a number of rounds equal to the sand giant's Hit Dice (19 rounds for a typical sand giant). A sand giant does not need to concentrate to maintain the arm and can direct it to attack a new target or adapt a new tactic as a free action.  The arm's base attack bonus is equal to that of the giant that created it, and it deals slam damage equal to the slam attack for a creature of its size (Huge). Any creature struck must succeed on a DC 29 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based, using the HD of the sand giant and the Strength of the fist of sand.  The arm has an AC of 20 (+12 natural, -2 size) and has hit points equal to three times the Constitution score of the sand giant that created it. It has a Strength score of 30.  The arm loses shape if it is reduced to 0 or less hit points, the duration expires, or the sand giant dies.

AAA	KEY:SandKraken ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SandKrakenRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Camouflage (Ex) Because it remains buried until it attacks, it takes a successful DC 20 Perception check to detect the presence of a sand kraken before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the sand kraken.

AAA	KEY:SandKraken ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SandKrakenRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Tentacles (Ex) The only part of a sand kraken that is normally exposed is its tentacles. For combat purposes, the creature's tentacles are treated as separate weapons.  A single tentacle has an AC 20 (touch 14) and 15 hit points. Once a tentacle takes more than 15 hit points of damage, it is destroyed. A sand kraken can no longer use the destroyed tentacle to make attacks, however the loss of a tentacle cause the creature no other penalties. Furthermore, damage dealt to a tentacle does not count against the creature's total hit points. Lost tentacles regrow in 1d4 days.

Those hearing this sound must make a successful DC 15 Will save or become entranced. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. If the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same sand stalker's attraction for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.  An entranced victim takes the most direct route possible, walking toward the sand stalker. If the path leads into a dangerous area, (fire, over a cliff, and so on), that creature gets a second saving throw. Entranced creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the sand stalker stands there and offers no resistance to the monster's attacks. The effect continues for as long as the sand stalker's legs are subjected to wind. A bard's countersong ability allows the entranced creature to attempt a new Will save.

Scream (Su) A screaming devilkin can howl continuously as a free action. This painful howling affects all creatures within 60 feet that hear it. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be dazed for one round. The save DC is Charisma-based.

All creatures within 60 feet that hear the sound must make a successful DC 13 Will save or take 1d6 points of sonic damage each round they remain in the area. The screaming also distracts spellcasters attempting to cast spells. A spellcaster within the area must make a successful Concentration check (DC 10 + sonic damage taken) to successfully cast a spell. The screaming lasts for 1d4 rounds before ceasing for one round. After that, the skull remains silent unless a creature is within or moves within 40 feet of it-it then screams again and repeats the above cycle. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Additionally, this cacophonous scream risks attracts wandering monsters. Whenever the skull first screams, the GM makes an additional wandering monster check to determine if nearby creatures come to investigate the source of the disturbance.

AAA	KEY:ScreamingSkull ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ScreamingSkullRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:

Scylla

AAA	KEY:Scylla ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ScyllaRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Boil Water (Ex) If a scylla uses its heat ability (see below) for 3 consecutive rounds and doesn't move more than 5 feet from its current location, the water surrounding it (in a 10-foot radius and to a depth of 10 feet) begins to rapidly churn and boil. Creatures caught in the boiling water take 3d6 points of fire damage each round they remain in the area. A successful DC 22 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. Creatures wearing heavy clothing or medium or heavy armor take a -2 penalty on their saving throw. In addition, those wearing metal armor or coming into contact with very hot metal are affected as if by a heat metal spell. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Once the scylla moves from its location or shuts its heat ability off, the boiling water takes 3 rounds to return to its normal temperature (it still deals full damage during its cooling off period).

The scylla can target the same or different opponents with each head, if it wishes. Each blast deals 3d6 points of fire damage or half that amount if the target succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. The save DC is Constitution-based. This is effective both on the surface and underwater.  In any round that a head does not gulp water, it can bite.

Skunk

AAA	KEY:AAA ~ Skunk	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkunkRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Musk (Ex) Once per round, and no more than 5 times per day, a skunk can release a cloud of stinking musk that quickly fills a 5-foot area in front of it. A creature within or entering the area must succeed on a DC 10 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. One round later a second Fortitude save must be made (whether the first one succeeded or not) or the affected creature is blinded for 1d4 rounds. The save DCs are Constitution-based. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature, but does not remove the blindness. Creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the sickened effect but can still be blinded if they fail their save, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on both saving throws. The stench is highly potent, and short of magical means of cleaning, all cloth and such material continue to reek for 1d6 months. The odor is so strong that it doubles all chances for random encounters and imposes a -6 penalty on Stealth checks attempted while wearing clothing contaminated with a skunk's musk. Flesh, leather goods, metal goods (weapons, armor, and the like) must be washed in a concentrated mixture of vinegar over period of 1d3 days. Otherwise, the stench clings for at least one week, imposing the same modifiers to random encounters and Stealth checks.

Link to Caster (Ex) When a soul eater is summoned to the Material Plane, it creates a mental link between itself and the caster who summoned it. If a soul eater's victim (i.e., the creature it is summoned to slay) is killed before the creature can devour its soul, the soul eater returns at full speed to the caster and attacks him. Likewise, if a soul eater is defeated in battle (but not slain) by its target, the creature returns to the caster and attacks him. So long as both the caster and soul eater are on the same plane of existence, the soul eater can successfully locate the caster (again as though guided by discern location). If the caster leaves the plane, the link is temporarily broken. Once the caster returns, or the soul eater enters a plane the caster is on, the link is immediately restored.

Soul Slash (Su) If a soul reaper scores a critical hit with its scythe, the target must succeed on a DC 26 Fortitude save or have its soul torn from its body and pulled into the soul reaper's scythe. If the save succeeds, the victim takes an extra 3d6 points of damage. A soul reaper's scythe can hold a number of souls equal to its Charisma bonus (four souls for a typical soul reaper). This effect is similar to a trap the soul spell. The save DC is Charisma-based.  A creature's soulless body collapses into a desiccated husk, and in one day crumbles to dust.  To reclaim a captured soul, the reaper must be destroyed and its scythe shattered on consecrated ground. When the scythe is shattered, all souls trapped are released and seek their original body (if it's been less than one day since the body was killed). Creatures without a body are left to wander in spirit form but can be returned to life through the successful casting of a miracle, wish, or true resurrection spell.

Approaching creatures must make a successful DC 20 Perception check to notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free.

The horn is AC 20, hardness 10, and has 20 hit points. A tentacled horror's horn cannot be removed unless it is helpless. It takes a successful DC 40 Strength or 10 points of damage to the horn to remove a tentacled horror's horn.

Tentamort

AAA	KEY:Tentamort ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TentamortRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Paralysis (Ex) The digestive fluid injected by a tentamort's stinging tentacle is coupled with a paralytic poison as well that forces the victim to make a DC 13 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for one minute. Immunity to poison negates this effect.

AAA	KEY:Tentamort ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TentamortRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Liquefy Organs (Ex) A tentamort can insert the needlelike projection from its stinging tentacle into the body of a foe grappled by either tentacle. Doing so requires a successful melee attack, and the tentamort cannot insert the projection into a creature grappled with its constricting tentacle if its stinging tentacle is also grappling a foe.  Once inserted, the tentamort injects a digestive liquid and a paralytic poison (see above) through the hollow barb that liquefies the victim's internal organs; the tentamort draws this liquefied slurry back through the hollow needle into its own body to feed. This attack deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round the tube remains inserted in a foe.  Once the needle is removed or the tentamort is killed, the foe continues to take 1 point of Constitution damage until it succeeds at a DC 13 Fortitude save. This Constitution damage can be halted by spells or effects that remove disease or heal ability score damage (including lesser restoration).

The Oinodaemon Daemon

AAA	KEY:TheOinodaemon ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TheOinodaemonRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Disease (Ex) Daemonic Plague: Slam-injury; save Fort DC 47, onset 1 day; frequency 1/ day; effect 2d6 Con damage; cure 3 consecutive saves.  Each time the victim takes Con damage, it must succeed on a second Fort save or lose 2 points of the Con damage permanently. The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:TheOinodaemon ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TheOinodaemonRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Transfixing Gaze (Su) A living creature within 30 feet that meets the Oinodaemon's gaze must succeed on a DC 46 Will save, or be held (as the hold person spell, CL 37th). An affected creature can attempt a new save each round to break the effects if it has 24 HD or more; otherwise, only the Oinodaemon can release it, or a wish or miracle can break the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. If the Oinodaemon is slain or moves more than 30 feet away from a held creature, it is automatically released. The Oinodaemon only has to remain within range to maintain this ability; he does not have to concentrate.

Staff of the Lower Planes () This 12-foot long, black wooden staff can only be wielded by the current Oinodaemon or any daemon he allows to wield it. In anyone else's hands, the staff functions as a normal quarterstaff. Upon the current Oinodaemon's death, the staff can be wielded (and it functions as detailed below) by the new Oinodaemon. The staff has the powers listed below. All powers function as the

spell of the same name (CL 25th or the wielder's caster level, whichever is higher). Save DCs are 20 + spell level.
- Doom, fear (1 charge)
- Dominate monster, geas/quest, mass charm monster, unholy aura (2 charges)
- Once per day, wish (grant another's wish) (2 charges)

The staff has an unlimited number of charges, but no more than 50 charges may be expended in a single day.

The staff's powers automatically overcome any other daemon's spell resistance. Any non-daemon that touches the staff takes 10d8 points of electricity damage per round of contact (no save) and gains two negative levels each round it touches the staff. The Fortitude save to remove a negative level has a DC of 35 and can result in actual level loss on a failed save.

Living creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or sickened every round they remain in the area and for one round after leaving the area. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Time Elemental

AAA	KEY:TimeElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Alter Age (Su) Once per day, a noble time elemental can age a creature simply by touching it (this requires a melee touch attack). If successful, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or advance forward one aging step (from adulthood to middle age, from middle age to old, from old to venerable, and so on). If a character ages, he takes all the effects to his physical ability scores, but does not gain any of the bonuses to his mental ability scores. A venerable creature affected by this ability dies (from massive cell death) and cannot be restored to life by mortal magic. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Alternately, a time elemental can use its alter age ability to reduce a character's age. If the target is unwilling, the time elemental must succeed on a melee touch attack.  An unwilling target can make a Fortitude save to avoid the effects. If the save fails, the target ages one age step backwards (from middle age to adulthood for example) and gains all bonuses to physical ability scores from his new age (simply flip the penalties listed on the aging table into an equal numbered bonus). A character that regresses in age does not reduce its mental ability scores. This ability does not affect a character that has died from old age.  A time elemental can also use this ability to age vegetable matter 10-200 years (older or younger) or mineral matter 100-2,000 years (older or younger).  Royal time elementals can use this ability twice per day.

AAA	KEY:TimeElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Cell Death (Ex) Damage dealt by a time elemental's slam attack does not heal naturally (but it can still be healed magically). Additionally, a creature slain by a time elemental can only be raised through the successful casting of a miracle, true resurrection, or wish spell.

AAA	KEY:TimeElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Foresight (Su) A time elemental can see a few seconds into the future. This ability prevents it from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or flanked. It also grants the time elemental an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom bonus. This ability can be negated, but the time elemental can restart it as a free action on its next turn.  Immunity to Temporal Magic (Ex) Time elementals are immune to all time-related spells and effects (including time stop, temporal stasis, and the like). Note, the time stop ability of the noble and royal time elementals can affect those time elementals of lesser power (i.e., a noble can affect a common and a royal can affect a noble or common).

AAA	KEY:TimeElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Multi-Manifestation (Su) A time elemental exists in several other dimensions at any given time. As a standard action, it can bring forth 1d4 of these manifestations to its current locale in order to gain multiple attacks that round. Treat each manifestation as a separate time elemental with hit points equal to the time elemental's current hit points. A manifestation cannot use any of the supernatural or spelllike abilities of the time elemental (a manifestation does however gain the time elemental's foresight ability). A time elemental cannot have more than four manifestations present at one time.  Because each manifestation is a part of the time elemental that called them, a successful attack on the time elemental or any of its manifestations deals an equal amount of damage to them all.

AAA	KEY:TimeElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:
Summon Time Elementals (Sp) Once per day, a royal time elemental can attempt to summon 1d4 common time elementals with a 70% chance of success or 1-2 noble time elementals with a 30% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell.

AAA	KEY:TimeElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Temporal Displacement (Su) By making a melee touch attack against a foe, a noble or royal time elemental can remove that creature from the current time stream if it fails a Fortitude save. The save is Constitution-based.  On a failed save, the creature disappears in a flash of white energy. For a number of minutes equal to the time elemental's Hit Dice, the displaced creature is effectively nonexistent. No form of magic, effect, or force can detect or aid such a creature. A displaced creature can attempt a Wisdom check (DC equal to the initial Fort DC) on its turn to break the effects and end the displacement. The save is Constitution-based.  When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the same space it was in before being displaced. If the space is occupied when the creature returns, it is shunted aside to the first open space and takes no damage. A noble or royal time elemental can use this ability three times per day.  Time Jaunt (Su) A time elemental can slip through the time stream and appear anywhere on the same plane of existence as if by greater teleport. This ability transports the time elemental and up to four other creatures within a 30-foot radius. Unwilling creatures can attempt a Will save to avoid being carried away. This ability is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name (caster level equal to the elemental's HD). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Time Stop (Sp) Noble and royal time elementals can create an effect identical to a time stop spell once per day (caster level equals the time elemental's HD).

Time Flayer

AAA	KEY:TimeFlayer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeFlayerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Foresight (Su) A time flayer can see a few seconds into the future. This ability prevents a time flayer from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or flanked. It also grants the time flayer an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom bonus. This ability can be negated, but the time flayer can restart it as a free action on its next turn.

AAA	KEY:TimeFlayer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeFlayerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Temporal Magic (Ex) Time flayers are immune to all time-related spells and effects (including time stop, temporal stasis, and the like).

AAA	KEY:TimeFlayer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeFlayerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Reality Bend (Su) As a free action, a time flayer can fold the dimensional space surrounding it so its true location is hard to discern. Attackers have a 50% miss chance each time they attack with melee or ranged weapons. This is similar to the miss chance granted by a displacement spell. See invisibility does not reveal the creature's location, but true seeing does.

AAA	KEY:TimeFlayer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeFlayerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Temporal Displacement (Su) As a melee touch attack, a time flayer can send a creature a few seconds into the future. A DC 18 Fortitude save negates. The save is Constitution-based.  On a failed save, the creature disappears in a flash of white energy only to reappear in the same space 1d4 rounds later. This effectively removes that creature from combat for the duration. If the space is occupied when the creature returns, it suffers no damage and is shunted aside. The time flayer can use this ability three times per day.

AAA	KEY:TimeFlayer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeFlayerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Time Jaunt (Su) As a standard action, a time flayer can slip through the time stream and appear anywhere on the same plane of existence as if by greater teleport. This ability transports the time flayer and up to four other creatures within a 30-foot radius that the time flayer designates.  Unwilling creatures can attempt a DC 18 Will save to avoid being carried away. This ability is otherwise similar to the greater teleport spell. The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:TimeFlayer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeFlayerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Unmaking (Su) An opponent slain by a time flayer is unmade-erased from the very fabric of time. No memories or recollections of the unmade creature exist anywhere in reality. Past events the creature was responsible for are now attributed to an unknown-even if they recently took place. For example, suppose a great hero saved a kingdom from certain doom and then suffers the unmaking. The kingdom is still safe, but no one can quite recall who saved it.  A creature that suffers the unmaking cannot be raised, resurrected, or restored to life by any means-not even a wish can restore an unmade creature. Only the direct intervention of a deity can restore one who suffers this fate.

Tombstone Fairy

AAA	KEY:TombstoneFairy ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TombstoneFairyRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Danse Macabre (Su) Once per night, a tombstone fairy can invoke a ritual to raise any evil creature from the dead. The ritual takes 10 minutes to perform and the target cannot have been dead longer than one day per HD of the tombstone fairy. Additionally, the target's body must be present during the ritual and its soul must be available for return (that is, if the target's soul is trapped, such as by a trap the soul spell, this ritual automatically fails).  A target unwilling to return to life can prevent its raising by making an opposed Charisma check against the tombstone fairy's Charisma check. If the tombstone fairy wins the check, the target's soul is forced into its body a it returns to life. If the target wins the opposed check, it prevents its raising, and the tombstone fairy cannot atte to raise that same target for one month.  During the ritual a portion of the target's soul transfers to funeral shroud or cloth. The tombstone fairy often retains shroud so as to force compliance from the returned tar Once the target does what the fairy desires, the tombst fairy finishes this ritual and transfers the last bit of the targ soul from the shroud into its body. If the funeral shroud is destroyed while it contains a part of the target's soul, the target instantly dies and can only be returned to life through the use of a resurrection, true resurrection, miracle or wish.  This ability otherwise resembles a raise dead spell.  A tombstone fairy can have only one funeral shroud (containing a target's soul) in its possession at one time.

AAA	KEY:TormentorDevil ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TormentorDevilRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:
Soulcatcher Net () A tormentor devil's net looks like a normal net and follows the rules for net attacks. The net has 20 hit points; the Escape Artist check to get free is DC 30; the net can be broken with a successful DC 30 Strength check. The net can entrap incorporeal creatures.  The net has many small razor-sharp barbs lining it. These barbs deal 1d6 points of damage each round to any creature caught in the net, including incorporeal creatures. (The incorporeal creature's 50% chance to avoid damage from a corporeal source does not apply to this attack.)

Transposer

AAA	KEY:Transposer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TransposerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Blending Disguise (Ex) When using its disguise self spell-like ability, the transposer can make itself look like a creature of the humanoid or monstrous humanoid type. When disguising itself, the transposer ignores the usual penalty for different race, age category, and gender. Finally, transposers gain a racial bonus equal to one half their racial Hit Dice to the Will save DC to penetrate the illusion of their disguise self ability.

AAA	KEY:Transposer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TransposerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Transposition (Su) An opponent hit by a transposer's slam attack becomes linked (transposed) to it by an invisible and undetectable field of energy for 1 hour if it fails a DC 14 Fortitude save. A transposer can have a number of opponents equal to its HD linked to it at one time. An opponent can be linked to more than one transposer (if it fails its save against each transposer's attack). The save DC is Constitution-based.  When a linked opponent attacks a transposer it is linked to, the creature gains hit points equal to the damage the attack would normally deal, and the attacker takes the damage. Other opponents linked to that transposer are unharmed. A transposer can gain up to the maximum hit points allowed by its Hit Dice. It cannot gain bonus or temporary hit points from this ability.  Curative magic cast on a transposer by a transposed opponent damages the creature by the amount it would normally heal, and heals a like amount of damage on the one who cast the spell. (Other linked creatures are unaffected.) Curative magic cast on a transposed opponent works normally but does not heal or harm a linked transposer. Curative magic cast on a transposer by a non-linked opponent functions normally.  Opponents not linked to the transposer can attack and affect the creature normally.

If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and deals buffet damage each round the hold is maintained. Further, a grappled opponent must hold its breath or suffocate. Attacks that hit a smothering trapper deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.

Acid (Ex) The tri-flower frond can tip its yellow bloom over a slumbering or prone foe and shower it with sap laden with potent digestive enzymes. This sap does 1d6 points of acid damage per round to flesh until it is washed or scraped off.

AAA	KEY:TriFlowerFrond ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TriFlowerFrondRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Camouflage (Ex) Since a tri-flower frond looks like a normal flowering plant when at rest, it takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the plant.

AAA	KEY:TriFlowerFrond ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TriFlowerFrondRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Fluid Drain (Ex) Against a sleeping or helpless foe, a tri-flower frond can release a needle-sharp tendril from its red bloom that pierces its target and drains its body fluids. This deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round, and the victim is considered grappled.

AAA	KEY:TriFlowerFrond ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TriFlowerFrondRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Sleep Pollen (Ex) A creature struck by one of the tri-flower frond's tendrils must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or fall into a deep, coma-like slumber from which it cannot be awakened that lasts for 1-4 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based. Resistances and immunities to poison apply against the pollen, but resistances or immunities to sleep effects do not. A slumbering victim can also be awakened by a successful DC 20 Heal check after one minute of treatment.  A creature that falls victim to the sleep pollen is subject to the tri-flower frond's acid and fluid drain attacks, both as free actions.

Sometimes when an injured troblin regenerates, its body warps in an inexplicable fashion. A severed arm may regrow as two arms, or a scar may grow to cover the troblin's entire body in thick skin. Further, if a troblin suffers a critical hit in melee, it has a 25% chance of gaining a mutation once it is fully healed. See the sidebar for random mutations.

AAA	KEY:Tsathar ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TsatharRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Implant (Ex) Tsathar are sexless, reproducing by injecting eggs into living hosts. An egg can be implanted only into a helpless host creature. The host must be of Small size or larger. Giant frogs, bred for this very purpose, are the most common host. Implanting an egg requires one minute to perform.  Accompanying the egg is an anaesthetizing poison that causes the host to fall unconscious for the two-week gestation period of the egg unless the host succeeds on a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw; this save DC includes a +8 racial bonus. If the save succeeds, the host remains conscious, but is violently ill (-10 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks) 24 hours before the eggs hatch. When the eggs mature, the young tsathar emerges from the host, killing it in the process.  A remove disease spell rids the victim any implanted eggs. A DC 20 Heal check can be attempted to surgically extract an egg from a host. If the check fails, the healer can try again, but each attempt (successful or not) deals 1d6 points of damage to the patient.

AAA	KEY:Tsathar ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TsatharRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Leap (Ex) Tsathar are incredible jumpers, able to leap up to 30 feet horizontally or 10 feet vertically. They have a +14 racial bonus on horizontal jumps, or +24 on vertical jumps, and they do not need to make a 10-foot minimum running start before jumping to avoid doubling the jumping DCs. Tsathar can always take 10 when making an Acrobatics check to jump.  When a tsathar begins its round by jumping next to an opponent it can make a full attack in the same round. A tsathar wearing medium or heavy armor or carrying a medium or heavy load cannot use this ability.

AAA	KEY:Tsathogga ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TsathoggaRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Seeping Darkness (Su) As a free action, Tsathogga can billow forth a cloud of thick, dark fog from his skin. This fog spreads to fill a 50-foot radius, 50 feet high. The darkness generated by the cloud nullifies nonmagical lights and magical lights of 5th level or lower within the area.  Furthermore, all creatures in the area gain concealment, including those that can normally see in such darkness, tough Tsathogga is able to see normally in it. Light descriptor spells of 5th level or lower (such as daylight, dancing lights, and light) are incapable of brightening the area.  This cloud remains for 10 minutes before dispersing. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the cloud in 4 rounds; a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses the cloud in 1 round. Tsathogga cannot use this ability underwater. Once the cloud disperses, Tsathogga can issue a new one if he desires.

A control weather spell instantly slays a wind walker if it fails a Fortitude save against the spell.  A haste spell deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6) to a wind walker. A Fortitude save halves the damage. In addition, a haste spell increases the damage the wind walker deals with its wind blast attack by +1d6 for one round.  An ice storm spell deals no damage to a wind walker, but is affected as if by a fear spell if it fails a Will saving throw against ice storm.  A slow spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to a wind walker. A Will save halves the damage.  A summoned or called wind walker is affected normally by magical barriers that restrict or inhibit called or summoned creatures (such as antimagic field).

Wind Blast (Ex) A wind walker attacks using the air surrounding it, transforming it into a forceful blast that deals 2d6+6 points of damage to all creatures within reach. The wind walker makes a single attack roll at its full attack bonus against each opponent within reach as a standard action.

Witch-Doll Golem

AAA	KEY:WitchDollGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitchDollGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Extra Damage against Foe (Su) When it successfully establishes a witch-doll link, a witch-doll golem deals an extra 1d8 points of damage against its programmed target each time one of its attacks hits.

AAA	KEY:WitchDollGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitchDollGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:
Find Target (Sp) When ordered to find its programmed target, a witch-doll golem does so unerringly, as though guided by discern location.

AAA	KEY:WitchDollGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitchDollGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Linked Attack (Su) When a witch-doll golem successfully establishes a witchdoll link, any damage taken by the witch-doll golem from any source other than the linked host deals half its damage to the golem and half its damage to the linked target so long as they are within 60 feet of each other. Only the linked target can successfully attack a witchdoll golem and not take "linked damage". Attacks that don't damage a witch-doll golem (because of its immunities or its damage reduction) likewise deal no damage to the linked target. Attacks that damage the linked target do not damage the witchdoll golem (the link it establishes is one way). Healing (or repair in the case of the witch-doll golem) is not passed through the link.  A witch-doll golem cannot be programmed to attack itself in order to damage its programmed target.

AAA	KEY:WitchDollGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitchDollGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Witch-Doll Link (Su) A witch-doll golem can establish an invisible link between itself and its programmed target by making a successful melee attack against its programmed target. If successful, the opponent can attempt a DC 19 Fortitude save to resist the link. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. A witch-doll link is broken if the witch-doll golem is destroyed, the target dies, or the witch-doll golem is programmed with a new target. A witch-doll golem cannot establish this link with any other creature other than its programmed target.

AAA	KEY:WitchDollGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitchDollGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A witch-doll golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance.  In addition, certain spells function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A confusion spell slows it (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw.  A mending spell heals 2d6 hit points.

AAA	KEY:WitchDollGolem ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitchDollGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Resist Magic (Ex) A witch-doll golem gains a +4 bonus on all saving throws against any spell or spell-like ability or effect cast by its programmed target (provided the effect gets past its immunity to magic). The witch-doll does not have to be linked to its target to gain this bonus.

Witherstench

AAA	KEY:Witherstench ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitherstenchRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Stench (Ex) A witherstench constantly emits a putrid stench that nearly every form of animal life finds offensive. All living creatures (except witherstenches) within 30 feet of a witherstench must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be nauseated (unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything else requiring attention; can only take a single move action per turn) for as long as they remain within 30 feet of the creature. Moving out of the affected area leaves the character sickened (-2 penalty on all attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks) for 1 round after which time he recovers immediately. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same witherstench's stench for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws.

-----------------------------------------------

Witherweed

AAA	KEY:Witherweed ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitherweedRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Camouflage (Ex) A witherweed looks like normal grass and weeds when at rest; it takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the plant. Dwarves can use stonecunning to notice the subterranean version.

AAA	KEY:Witherweed ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitherweedRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Death Smoke (Ex) A witherweed that takes at least 1 point of damage from a fire effect releases a cloud of deadly smoke that billows forth and quickly fills a 20-foot radius surrounding it. Creatures within the area must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution damage. One minute later, another Fortitude save (same DC) must be made to avoid another 2d6 points of Constitution damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based. The cloud remains for 1 round per HD of the witherweed but a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the cloud in 1 round.

Wizards Shackle

AAA	KEY:WizardsShackle ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WizardsShackleRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Arcanesense (Su) A wizard's shackle can automatically detect the location of any arcane spellcaster within 30 feet.
This functions in a similar fashion to a detect evil spell but there is no chance the wizard's shackle is stunned and it is not blocked by stone, lead, or other material.

AAA	KEY:WizardsShackle ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WizardsShackleRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Attach (Ex) If a wizard's shackle hits with a bite attack, it latches onto the opponent's body. An attached wizard's shackle is effectively grappling its prey. The wizard's shackle loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 14, but holds on with great tenacity. Wizard's shackles have a +20 racial bonus on grapple checks (already figured into the CMB and CMD entries above).  An attached wizard's shackle can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself. To remove an attached wizard's shackle through grappling, the opponent must achieve a pin against the wizard's shackle.

AAA	KEY:WizardsShackle ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WizardsShackleRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Spell Drain (Su) A wizard's shackle drains spells when attached to an arcane spellcaster. Each round the wizard's shackle remains attached, it drains 1d6 levels of prepared spells or unused slots, beginning with the highest level spell or slot available. For example, on a roll of 4 against a 5th-level wizard, a wizard's shackle drains four levels of prepared spells. The wizard currently has one 3rd-level spell, two 2nd-level spells, and three 1st-level spells prepared. The wizard's shackle drains the 3rd-level spell and one of the 1st-level spells (determined randomly).  A creature drained of spells or slots can attempt a DC 12 Intelligence check with a +2 bonus to notice that something is wrong (though unless he searches his body, he might still overlook the wizard's shackle). Once a wizard's shackle has drained at least 4 spell levels, it detaches and crawls away to digest its meal. Lost spells or slots can be regained normally.

Fiery Gaze (Su) A creature that meets Xaphan's gaze must succeed on a DC 36 Will save or be affected as follows: 1st-round: The victim's blood begins to boil, dealing 3d6 points of fire damage this round; the victim takes a -2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, ability and skill checks, and saves. A DC 37 Fortitude save halves the fire damage but does not negate the penalties. 2nd-round: The victim's blood reaches searing temperatures and begins to burn away muscle and flesh; the circumstance penalty increases to -4. Smoke rises from the victim's flesh. The victim takes 6d6 points of fire damage this round.
