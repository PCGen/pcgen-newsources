The Artisan			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,The Artisan],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]			STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NUMCHOICES=1|SKILL|Appraise|Heal		BONUS:SKILL|Appraise,Heal|1|TYPE=Trait					CSKILL:LIST							DESC:Precision is important in getting exactly what you want, and you give careful consideration in building everything from homes and vases to roads and empires. Your own attention to detail has proven vital in rebuilding Roslar’s Coffer from the orc occupation a decade ago, whether you are an accountant, architect, engineer, or herbalist. Your attention to detail provides you a +1 trait bonus on Appraise and Heal checks, and one of these skills becomes a class skill for you. Once per day, you can spend a full round casting a spell you can cast that has a normal casting time of 1 standard action to increase your effective caster level for that spell by 1. This ability has no affect on spells with a casting time other than 1 standard action.																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.6
The Lawbringer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,The Lawbringer],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]																																		DESC:The frontier is a land of risk and disorder, and while people are welcome to brave those elements themselves, they all too often bring pain down upon folk who never wanted such a risk. You might serve on the town guard or as part of a detachment of soldiers supported by Vigil, or you could be simply a concerned farmer who endures when others cannot, but your purpose is to stand as a bulwark against the cruel whims of fate for anyone who needs it. You gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against fear effects. If you have the aura of courage class feature, the bonus provided by your aura increases by 1. Your courage is inspiring; the first time each day you are knocked unconscious or killed, all allies within 30 feet of you immediately gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your level plus your Charisma modifier, as they rally to your defense. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute.																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.6	ASPECT:SaveBonus|+2 trait bonus on saving throws against fear effects
The Optimist		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,The Optimist],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]																																		DESC:People don’t need to take your word that things are getting better; they only need to look around and see the proof before their eyes. The town’s recovery from the orc occupation more than a decade ago is all but complete, and the monster in the Sarenite temple outside of town has finally been bested. Your irrepressible sense of optimism seems to fly in the face of the hard life that most residents of Roslar’s Coffer face, but you’re convinced that your positive attitude lifts up your community. You gain a +1 trait bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. Further, your optimism can be infectious. As a swift action a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), you can grant this bonus to an ally within 10 feet. This bonus lasts for 1 minute.

The Outsider		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,The Outsider],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]			STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NUMCHOICES=1|SKILL|Stealth|Survival	BONUS:SKILL|Stealth,Survival|1|TYPE=Trait					CSKILL:LIST							DESC:You don’t have a place, but the frontier seems comfortable enough for now. Maybe you’re too informal for city life, too selfish for Lastwall’s general culture of camaraderie, or too scarred by things you’ve seen to entirely trust another person. You are accustomed to moving without drawing much attention to yourself, gaining a +1 trait bonus on Stealth and Survival checks, and one of these skills is always a class skill for you. Accustomed to working alone, you gain only half the benefit (+1) from aid another actions, but you’re accustomed to doing the job right the first time and so increase the bonus you provide by 1 when aiding another character.																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.7
The Pessimist		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,The Pessimist],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]															BONUS:SAVE|Will|1|TYPE=Trait															DESC:You expect the worst and have rarely been disappointed. Your dour outlook may hail from the original destruction of Roslar’s Coffer at the hands of the Twisted Nail tribe, the exile of the faithful from the nearby Sarenite temple, or some more personal misfortune, but it has set you apart among the largely forward-thinking population of Lastwall. Your faith that the worst possible outcome will occur grants you a +1 trait bonus on Will saving throws. Your frustrating pessimism can spur friends to succeed just to spite you; once per day as a free action, you can force an ally within 30 feet to reroll a saving throw she just failed, using the better of the two results.																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.7
The Reclaimer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,The Reclaimer],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]															BONUS:SKILL|Perception|1|TYPE=Trait														DESC:You lost something precious in the destruction of Roslar’s Coffer 12 years ago—a home, a legacy, perhaps even family—but returned because a soul shouldn’t run from pain, but heal from it. Rebuilding your life and preventing that same hurt from dragging down others drives you to serve and protect, perhaps as a politician, charity worker, healer, or soldier, but that same loss fills you with an uncharitable anger that is often difficult to reconcile. Your wary eyes grant you a +1 trait bonus on Perception checks. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack and damage rolls against any opponent that dealt hit point damage to one of your allies in the previous round.																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.7
The Snoop			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,The Snoop],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]																BONUS:SKILL|Knowledge (History),Knowledge (Local)|1|TYPE=Trait	CSKILL:Knowledge (History)|Knowledge (Local)	DESC:You know a little bit about most everything and everyone in Roslar’s Coffer. It may be your profession, as you could be an archivist, crier, or librarian—or you simply make a hobby of gossip. Either way, you have a gift for recall and reading others. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (history) and Knowledge (local) checks, and these both become class skills for you. Once each day you can reroll a single Bluff or Sense Motive check against a creature you have known for at least 24 hours, using the better result.																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.7
The Word			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,The Word],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]																BONUS:SAVE|Fortitude|1|TYPE=Trait														DESC:In a nation overcrowded with faith, you often worry that your message is drowned out, but nonetheless important. The souls in Roslar’s Coffer needed comfort and charity once upon a time, but have bounced back so fully—in part thanks to your hard work—that you worry you’ve made yourself unnecessary. You are accustomed to long hours, granting you a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saving throws. Your faith is invigorating, and once per day you can lay on hands as a paladin of half your character level (minimum 1). If you gain the lay on hands ability from a class, you instead gain one additional use of lay on hands each day.

#Chance Savior		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Chance Savior],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]			DESC:Fate smiled on you and Professor Lorrimor one day in the not so distant past. Through a matter of pure chance, you were in a position to save the late scholar's life and did so. His gratitude was effusive, and he promised that he would never forget you. You are unsure of the nature of the summons in his will, but believe he may have listed you as a possible heir in thanks for saving him from an untimely demise. Your ability to think quickly on your feet has stayed with you, and you quite often feel that you're in the right place at the right time. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Initiative checks.

#Subject of Study		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Subject of Study],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]		DESC:Professor Lorrimor approached you as part of his studies, as he had heard that you had survived a recent encounter with a strange monster or had another fateful encounter. Interested in the conditions of the run-in and the means by which you avoided death or injury, he met with you and maintained frequent correspondence until several months ago. The scars of your experience and his continual reminders of the encounter prompted you to hone your skills lest you someday face the same type of creature again. The professor assisted you in this endeavor, providing you with insight into the anatomy and defenses of the creature that attacked you. Years of study have improved your combat effectiveness against your chosen foe. Choose a non-humanoid creature type (and subtype if outsider). You gain a +1 bonus on damage rolls against creatures of this type.

#Inspired by Greatness	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Inspired by Greatness],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]		DESC:Whether you knew Professor Lorrimor well or only in passing, as a colleague or competitor, his career and lifetime of discovery inspired you to be better at what you do. As you honed your craft, you and the professor corresponded, and he was delighted to hear that he had directly or indirectly motivated you to strive for your full potential. Saddened by the news of his death, you feel that you should honor his memory by fulfilling his final wishes and attending his funeral, and by ever striving to attain greater heights and someday match the influence and impact of your idol. From now on, you always cast %1 at +1 caster level.|%LIST																																																																		STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NUMCHOICES=1|SPELLS|SPELLTYPE=Arcane|SPELLTYPE=Divine			BONUS:CASTERLEVEL|SPELL.%LIST|1																				SOURCEPAGE:p.12
#Making Good on Promises	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Making Good on Promises],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]	DESC:At some point in the past, Professor Lorrimor did you a favor under the condition that he would someday call on you to repay it. After he came to your aid, however, you never saw nor heard from him again, leaving you with a sense of unending anticipation that each day might be the day you were asked to return the favor. Yet that day never came, and your fears and anxiety about what the professor would call on you to do abated. Assuming the old man had either forgotten about you or died, you eventually assumed you'd never have to follow through on your end of the bargain. When you received word of the professor's death, and that he had named you specifically in his will, your dread of what he could possibly want from you has grown throughout your entire journey to Ravengro. Years of living with the fear and uncertainty of the unclaimed debt to Professor Lorrimor have inured you to extreme anxiety. You gain a +2 trait bonus on saves against fear effects.																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.12	ASPECT:SaveBonus|+2 trait bonus on saves vs. fear effects
#On the Payroll		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,On the Payroll],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]			DESC:Whether he needed a bodyguard in a rough neighborhood, a guide to an isolated archeological dig, or information on a specialized topic, Professor Lorrimor was never shy about hiring professionals to help him attain his goals. Over the course of his long career, thousands of people throughout the world served his needs and benefited from his generous wages (usually covered by his academic benefactor at the time). He had contacts in most areas of expertise in every corner of the known world, a knack for recognizing talent, and a desire to be surrounded by the best and brightest at all times. Whatever job the professor originally hired you for, your performance captured his attention, and he hired you many times throughout your career, sometimes even for jobs away from your home, always paying your expenses and compensating you well for your time. In your area of expertise, you are among the best.Your years of hard work have paid off, granting you an additional 150 gp in starting wealth.

#Teacher's Pet		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Teacher's Pet],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]			DESC:Professor Lorrimor traveled the Inner Sea region lecturing and teaching at universities in locations as far-flung as Manaket and Magnimar, and as different in scope as the bardic colleges of Taldor and the battle colleges of the River Kingdoms. Speaking before standing-room-only lecture halls on topics as widely ranging as military strategy, planar anomalies, theology, and agriculture, Lorrimor's time was highly valued among those ambitious to benefit from his expertise. Despite this, he still managed to provide one-on-one assistance to the most promising of his acolytes. When he saw the potential for greatness in one of his charges, he took it upon himself to nurture their spark. You were such a student. Over the course of several months, you and the late professor spent hours debating the finer points of your topic of interest, and the intellectual doors he opened for you continue to flavor your outlook on the world. You gain a +2 trait bonus to one Knowledge skill of your choosing and consider it a class skill.
