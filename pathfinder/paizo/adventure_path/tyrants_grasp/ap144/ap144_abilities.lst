#A kludge to allow the Yamaraj-Feather Cloak to add Immunity to Electricity and Immunity to Death Effects as supernatural abilities, not extraordinary.

This damage is positive energy damage if the target is undead, or negative energy damage if the target is living; creatures that are neither living nor dead, such as constructs, are unaffected by this ability.|ceil(MortalUsherLVL/2)

Nosoi Plague Mask			KEY:Mortal Usher ~ Nosoi Plague Mask			CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:ClassFeatures.Mortal Usher Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural											DESC:At 3rd level, a mortal usher can conjure or dismiss a nosoi plague mask as a free action. This plague mask is a physical manifestation of the mortal usher’s soul and cannot be destroyed or stolen, though its magic can be suppressed by an antimagic field or similar effect. As long as the mortal usher’s nosoi plague mask is conjured, the mortal usher gains the ability to cast invisibility on himself as a standard action with a caster level = %1. In addition, the mortal usher can activate the nosoi plague mask as a standard action, forcing all living and undead creatures within a 60-foot radius to attempt a Will saving throw (DC %2). Those that fail are fascinated; this effect continues for every round the mortal usher maintains the effect as a swift action and for 1 round thereafter. The mortal usher cannot use the invisibility effect of the plague mask while using its fascinate ability, and a creature that saves against the fascination effect is immune for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect; it can affect undead even though they would normally be immune to mind-affecting effects.|5+MortalUsherLVL|15+MortalUsherLVL
Catrinas Calm			KEY:Mortal Usher ~ Catrinas Calm				CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:ClassFeatures.Mortal Usher Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural											DESC:At 5th level, a mortal usher emits a 30-foot-radius aura that acts as a calm emotions spell on creatures within its area, with a DC of %1. Creatures are entitled to a new saving throw each time they reenter the area of the aura after leaving it, and a creature who successfully saves against the aura’s effects is immune to it for 24 hours. The mortal usher can suppress or resume this aura as a swift action.|16+MortalUsherLVL

Morrigna Wrappings		KEY:Mortal Usher ~ Morrigna Wrappings			CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:ClassFeatures.Mortal Usher Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural											DESC:At 7th level, a mortal usher gains the ability to designate any cloak, scarf, robe, or shirt in his possession as his wrappings, granting it unique powers in addition to any abilities or enchantments it may already have. The wrappings grant the mortal usher a natural armor bonus equal to half his class level as long as it is in his possession, and they can be used as a magic whip that can be wielded even if the mortal usher’s hands are full. When used as a whip, the wrappings gain an enhancement bonus equal to the mortal usher’s class level. These bonuses can be added to the whip to increase its enhancement bonus to a maximum of +5 (minimum +1), or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: brilliant energy, disruption (this supersedes the normal requirement that a disruption weapon must be a bludgeoning weapon), flaming, flaming burst, frost, holy, icy burst, shock, shocking burst, unholy, or vorpal. Adding these properties reduces the enhancement bonus granted by this ability by an amount equal to the property’s cost. The mortal usher can change how these properties and enhancements are assigned, or designate a new item as his wrappings, after an 8-hour rest.

Yamaraj-Feather Cloak		KEY:Mortal Usher ~ Yamaraj-Feather Cloak			CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:ClassFeatures.Mortal Usher Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural											DESC:At 10th level, a mortal usher becomes immune to electricity and death effects, and whenever he is struck by an attack or effect dealing electricity damage, he regains 1 hit point per 3 points of electricity damage the attack or effect would normally deal. If the amount of healing would cause the mortal usher to exceed his maximum hit points, he gains any excess as temporary hit points (maximum 50) that last for 1 hour.

#Mortal Usher Mortal Talents adds to class features of selected previous class
#These lines "populate" the ability category/ability pool Mortal Usher Mortal Talents Class...but only with those corresponding to the classes that the character has in addition to mortal usher (which is typically only one).
#They also apply the right ability automatically without invoking the ability pool chooser ("Feats & Abilities") in the UI if only one class before mortal usher (which is the most common case).
