Tidal Distortion						KEY:Tidal Trickster ~ Tidal Distortion												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TidalTricksterClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES		SOURCEPAGE:p.55																																																																																	DESC:While making a full attack underwater, you can give up one attack to create a tidal distortion. When you create a tidal distortion, you move up to 10 feet. If any part of your movement includes a square adjacent to one or more foes, you can choose one of those foes and attempt a Bluff check with a DC of 11 + either the enemy's Sense Motive or Swim modifier, whichever is higher. Your Bluff check is subject to any penalties the attack roll you sacrificed would have taken, and if you trade an iterative attack gained from having a high base attack bonus, you also takes a penalty based on that attack's lower base attack bonus (a -5 penalty for the second iterative attack, a -10 penalty for the third iterative attack, and a -15 penalty for the fourth iterative attack, if you manage to gain one). If you succeed at the Bluff check, the movement doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity from that foe and the foe becomes off-balance (see Aquatic Adventures page 45) until its next turn. You can give up any number of your attacks in a given full attack to create tidal distortions, but you can't give up two consecutive attacks.
