You assume this form and can maintain it until you regain your daily uses of reactive aspect or use this ability again.  This adaptation does not count against the maximum number of forms you can assume at once.  You can select a form that has a minimum level only if your character is at least 3 higher than the minimum level.  At 15th level you can maintain up to two lasting adaptations simultaneously, spending additional minute and two uses of your reactive aspect eacth time you assume a new adaptation.		SOURCEPAGE:13
Unfettered Wild Shape						KEY:Adaptive Shifter ~ Unfettered Wild Shape								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shifter Class Features.AdaptiveShifterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																																											DESC:You gain the ability to turn into other creatures.  This functions as druids wild shape ability, except you do not gain the ability to turn into an elemental.  Your effective druid level is equal to your Shifter level.  You can use this ability for a number of hours per day equal to half your effective druid level.  This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-hour increments.  For abilities that function based on "uses of wild shape", each hour of unfettered wild shape counts as use.																																															SOURCEPAGE:13
