Controlled Patterns		CATEGORY:FEAT			TYPE:General			PRETEXT:Pattern Message, Spell Focus (illusion), CL7	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Pattern Message,Spell Focus (illusion)	PREMULT:1,[PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=7],[PREVARGTEQ:CasterLevel_Highest,7]					DESC:You can modify your pattern spells to reduce their chance of affecting certain targets			STACK:NO	MULT:NO					SOURCEPAGE:p.42		BENEFIT:When you cast a spell from the pattern subschool, as a free action, you can choose a specific creature or subtype to shield from the spell's full effects. Creatures of the selected type or subtype that are affected by the spell reduce the save DC of the spell by 4. At 11th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you can specify an additional creature type or subtype to protect ( up to four protected types at 19th level).  If a creature has multiple subtypes that you specified when casting your spell, the reduction in the spell's save DC stacks for each specified type or subtype. For example, if you specified the outsider creature type and the demon and evil subtypes, then your pattern spell's DC would be 12 lower for outsiders with demon and evil subtypes.
Pattern Message			CATEGORY:FEAT			TYPE:General			PRETEXT:CL3												PREMULT:1,[PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=3],[PREVARGTEQ:CasterLevel_Highest,3]																					DESC:You've become skilled at inserting secret messages into your pattern illusions.				STACK:NO	MULT:NO					SOURCEPAGE:p.42		BENEFIT:When you cast a spell from the pattern subschool, you can embed a short message within the effect. You designate any number of the spell's targets to receive this encoded message, regardless of language, but only a creature failing its save against your pattern spell can receive your message. This message is delivered visually, and there is no verbal component that other creatures might overhear. During each round you concentrate to maintain a pattern spell, you can change the embedded message and the targets that receive it.
Shifting Patterns		CATEGORY:FEAT			TYPE:General			PRETEXT:Spell Focus (illusion), CL5						PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Spell Focus (illusion)	PREMULT:1,[PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=5],[PREVARGTEQ:CasterLevel_Highest,5]								DESC:You can focus your concentration when maintaining pattern effects to slowly move them.			STACK:NO	MULT:NO					SOURCEPAGE:p.42		BENEFIT:When you are concentrating to maintain a spell from the pattern subschool, you can move any area effects associated with that spell by up to 10 feet as a move action. Creatures within the new area of effect are subject to the spell as if it had just been cast ( attempting saves as normal ). When concentrating on a pattern spell that already allows you to move the effect, such as rainbow pattern, increase the distance you can move the pattern by 50%%.
