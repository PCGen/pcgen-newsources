A blackfire eruption acts as unholy blight, but its maximum damage is increased by 1d8 points (2d6 against good outsiders) per level of the sacrificed spell above 4th.  A blackfire eruption ignores the hardness of objects, as it unravels their fundamental reality.

If your caster level is higher than the caster level of the warding effect, it is immediately negated. If it is the same or lower, a caster level check (DC 11 + the caster level of the warding) is required to negate the warding effect.	DESC:Your breaching can penetrate and destroy an antimagic field, a prismatic sphere, or an extradimensional shelter like a mage's magnificent mansion, though a caster level check is always required regardless of your caster level. You can summon creatures into a naturally magic-dead area (such as the Mana Wastes) with a successful DC 31 caster level check, but the magic-dead area is not negated|PREVARGTEQ:Blackfire_Adept_CFP_Level,10.

Riftward Breaching	KEY:Blackfire Adept ~ Riftward Breaching	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																													DESC:Whenever one or more creatures appear via a conjuration effect (including calling, summoning, or teleportation effects) within 30 feet of you, you can as an immediate action unleash a blackfire eruption that targets all such creatures within 30 feet (but does not affect other creatures). Creatures that fail their saving throws are immediately transported to a random plane in the evil Outer Planes as though affected by a planeshift spell.

The champion of Irori must forgo his own saving throw, but adjacent allies gain improved cover against the effect, providing a +4 bonus on Reflex saves and improved evasion against the effect.

The champion of Irori can make this attack of opportunity even if he would be killed or incapacitated by the critical hit, resolving the attack after the critical hit deals damage but before he falls unconscious or dies. If the champion of Irori's attack of opportunity hits, it is automatically a critical threat.

Code of Conduct	KEY:Code of Conduct ~ Champion of Irori	SOURCEPAGE:p.	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Champion of IroriClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A champion of Irori embraces law and goodness as other paladins do, conducting himself with honor and protecting the innocent; he loses all class features if he ever willingly commits an evil act. A champion of Irori must avoid entanglements that would distract him from the pursuit of perfection, and may not incur debts nor give loans to others-though he is encouraged to give freely to those in need. He likewise turns away potential followers of any sort, and may not recruit (and must discharge from service, if already acquired) any cohort, follower, animal companion, familiar, special mount, or similar creature.
