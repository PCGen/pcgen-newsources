Dragon, Imperial
Although chromatic and metallic dragons are the most
widely known, other categories of true dragon exist.
Presented here are the f ive imperial dragons, regal
guardians of ancient lands and servants of cosmic balance.
AGE CATEGORIES
Many of a true dragon's abilities, attacks, and other statistics
improve as the dragon grows older. These increases are divided
into 12 age categories-as a dragon ages, its base statistics
change as noted on the Dragon Age Categories table.
Age Category: This is the age category's name.
Age in Years: This is the dragon's actual age.
CR: This column modifies the dragon's base CR.
Size: This column shows the number of size categories
to increase the dragon's base size by, depending on its age
(from
	SIZE:T
	to Small,
	SIZE:S
	to Medium, and so on). A true
dragon does not gain the standard increases to ability
scores when it achieves a larger size-instead, true dragons
gain ability score increases according to their age category,
as indicated on the Dragon Ability Scores table.
Hit Dice: This shows how many additional Hit Dice a
dragon gains over its base Hit Dice as it grows. Increases
to Hit Dice grant extra hit points, feats, and skill ranks
as well as increasing the dragon's base attack bonus and
base save bonuses. A dragon has skill ranks equal to 6 + its
Intelligence modifier per Hit Die. A dragon's increases to
ability scores for gaining Hit Dice are included in the total
ability score increases (see the Dragon Ability Scores table).
Natural Armor: This shows the amount the dragon's base
natural armor bonus increases by with each age category.
Breath Weapon: Each dragon has a breath weapon (see
Combat) that deals a base amount of damage. This multiplier
increases the number of dice of damage dealt by the dragon's
breath weapon. For example, a mature adult dragon with a base
breath weapon that deals 2d6 points of acid damage would
deal 14d6 points of acid damage (due to the ?7 multiplier).
COMBAT
The Dragon Attacks and Speeds table lists the attacks
a dragon can employ and the damage it deals (a dash
indicates a dragon of that size does not possess that natural
attack). Dragons gain other abilities described here when
they reach a specific age category.
Fly Speed: A dragon's f ly speed increases as indicated,
according to its size. Imperial dragons are wingless and
their f light is a supernatural ability.
Bite: This is a primary attack that deals the indicated
damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus
(even though it has more than one attack). A dragon's bite
attack has reach as if the creature were one size category
larger (+10 feet for
	SIZE:C
	dragons).
Claws: These primary attacks deal the indicated damage
plus the dragon's Strength bonus.
Gore: As they are wingless,
	SIZE:M
	and larger imperial
dragons make gore attacks with their horns instead of wing
attacks. A gore is a primary attack that deals the indicated
damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus. An
imperial dragon's gore attack has reach as if the creature were
one size category larger (+10 feet for
	SIZE:C
	dragons).
Tail Slap: The dragon can slap one foe each round with its
tail. A tail slap is a secondary attack that deals the indicated
damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus (this is
an exception to the normal secondary attack rules).
Crush (Ex): A flying or jumping
	SIZE:H
	or larger dragon can
land on foes as a standard action, using its whole body to crush
them. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents three
or more size categories smaller than the dragon. A crush attack
affects as many creatures as fit in the dragon's space. Creatures
in the affected area must succeed at a Reflex save (DC equal to
that of the dragon's breath weapon) or be pinned, automatically
taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the
dragon moves off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the
pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal.
Pinned foes take damage from the crush each round if they
don't escape. A crush attack deals the indicated damage plus
1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus.
Tail Sweep (Ex): This allows a
	SIZE:G
	or larger dragon
to sweep with its tail as a standard action. The sweep affects
a half-circle with a radius of 30 feet (or 40 feet for a Colossal
dragon), extending from an intersection on the edge of the
dragon's space in any direction. Creatures within the swept
area are affected if they are four or more size categories
smaller than the dragon. A tail sweep automatically deals
the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength
bonus. Affected creatures can attempt Ref lex saves to take half
damage (DC equal to that of the dragon's breath weapon).
Breath Weapon (Su): Using a breath weapon is a standard
action. A dragon can use its breath weapon once every 1d4
rounds, even if it possesses more than one breath weapon.
A breath weapon always starts at an intersection adjacent to
the dragon and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice.
Breath weapons come in two shapes, lines and cones, whose
areas vary with the dragon's size. If a breath weapon deals
damage, those caught in the area can attempt Ref lex saves
to take half damage. The save DC against a breath weapon is
10 + 1/2 the dragon's HD + the dragon's Con modifier. Saves
against various breath weapons use the same DC; the type of
saving throw is noted in the variety descriptions. A dragon can
use its breath weapon when it is grappling or being grappled.
ADDITIONAL DRAGON RULES
Dragon Senses (Ex): Dragons have darkvision 120 feet
and blindsense 60 feet. They see four times as well as a
human in dim light and twice as well in normal light.
92
Frightful Presence (Ex): A dragon's frightful presence
has a range equal to 30 feet ? the dragon's age category,
but otherwise functions as detailed in the universal
monster rules in the appendix.
Spells: A dragon knows and casts arcane spells as a
sorcerer of the level indicated in its specific description.
Its caster level depends on its age, as shown for each type.
Spell-Like Abilities: A dragon's caster level for its
spell-like abilities is equal to its total Hit Dice.
Damage Reduction: Dragons gain damage reduction
as they age, as indicated in each dragon's specific entry.
Their natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for
the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Immunities (Ex): Every dragon is immune to sleep
effects and paralysis effects. In addition, a dragon is
immune to one or more additional forms of attack or
energy damage no matter what its age, as given in its
specif ic description.
Spell Resistance (Ex): As dragons grow older, they
become more resistant to spells and spell-like abilities,
as indicated in the specif ic dragon descriptions. A
dragon's SR is equal to 11 + its CR.

Change Shape (Su) An adult or older forest dragon can assume
any humanoid form three times per day as if using polymorph.
Destructive Crush (Su) When an old or older forest dragon

forest dragon uses its breath weapon, it can summon a
greater earth elemental within the cone. The caster level for
these effects is the same as the dragon's caster level.

mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful
Bluff check against the listener's Sense Motive check.
Stony Death (Su) Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points
by a great wyrm forest dragon's breath weapon must also
make a Fortitude save (same DC as the forest dragon's
breath weapon) or be petrified as the flesh to stone spell.
This is a death effect.

Infused with the power of waves and storms, sea dragons-
or jiaolungs, as they are known in many lands-are draconic
protectors of oceans and their creatures. Possessing
tempestuous natures, sea dragons wander widely, sometimes
claiming thousands of miles
of ocean and coastlines
as their protectorates.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Borne Aloft (Su) Old or younger sky dragons fly with good
maneuverability while all older sky dragons have perfect.
Celestial Emissary (Su) Three times per day, a great wyrm sky
dragon can imbue others with the celestial aspect of the
oracle spell divine vessel*, but it can only be cast on another
willing creature of good alignment.
Change Shape (Su) A young or older sky dragon can assume any
humanoid form three times per day as if using polymorph.
Cloud Sight (Su) A very young or older sky dragon's sight is not
impeded by clouds or fog, or by spells that create areas of fog.
Grounding Breath (Su) Any flying creature damaged by the
breath weapon of an ancient or older sky dragon must
make a Fortitude save with the same DC as the sky dragon's
breath weapon or lose the ability to fly for 1d4 rounds.
Primal Lightning (Su) An old or older sky dragon's breath
weapon can affect creatures normally immune or resistant
to electricity damage. A creature immune to electricity
damage still takes half damage from the breath weapon (no
damage with a successful saving throw). Resistant creatures'
electricity resistance is treated as 10 less than normal.

Change Shape (Su) A young or older sovereign dragon can
assume any humanoid form three times per day as polymorph.
Dogmatic Discordance (Su) Good or evil creatures take a
-2 penalty when making saving throws against a sovereign
dragon's spells, spell-like abilities, breath weapon, and aura.
Golden Armor (Su) Once per day as a standard action, an old
or older sovereign dragon can cover its form in golden
armor, granting it a +4 armor bonus to AC and energy
resistance 15 to one energy type, chosen at the time the
armor is summoned. This armor lasts for a number of
rounds equal to the dragon's age category. The sovereign
dragon can dismiss the armor as a free action.
Master Counterspelling (Su) A great wyrm sovereign dragon can
counterspell once per round as an immediate action. It need
not know the spell it is countering, but can instead expend any
spell that is one level higher to automatically counter the spell.
Violent Retort (Ex) When a young or older sovereign dragon
takes damage from a melee attack critical hit, it can, as an
immediate action, make a claw or tail slap attack against the
creature that made the critical hit.
