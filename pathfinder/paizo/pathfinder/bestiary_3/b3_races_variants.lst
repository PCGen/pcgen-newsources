#VARIANT BANDERSNATCHES - Though no bandersnatch is ordinary, some are rarer than others. The most famous is the frumious bandersnatch, brimming with rage so fierce it burns. Variant bandersnatches may combine two or more of the abilities below.

Confounding Bandersnatch (+1 CR): Confounding bandersnatches drip infectious madness from their quills and Claws.  Poison (Ex) Claws and quills-injury; save Fort DC 29 frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes effect confused for 1 minute cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Frumious Bandersnatch (+2 CR): A frumious bandersnatch seethes with barely repressed rage and anger. If it misses with its Bite attack or falls below half of its hit points, it succumbs to such uncontrollable fury that it bursts into flame. While engulfed in these f lames, a frumious bandersnatch is affected as by a haste spell (this effect cannot be dispelled) and causes an additional 2d6 points of fire damage with each of its melee attacks and its quill defense ability. The fury lasts for 5 rounds, after which the bandersnatch cannot enter a fury again for another 5 rounds.  frumious bandersnatch has fire resistance 30.
Lesser Bandersnatch (-4 CR): Smaller or younger bandersnatches are still fearsome predators in their own right. A lesser bandersnatch is Huge, with 4 fewer Hit Dice than a typical bandersnatch. Reduce its physical ability scores by 4 each and its Wisdom and Charisma by 2 each. A lesser bandersnatch lacks quick recovery and deals 1d8+4 points of damage with its quill defense and pain abilities. Lesser bandersnatches never have any additional variant powers.
Magicbane Bandersnatch (+3 CR): These bandersnatches radiate an antimagic aura in a 20-foot radius. Should the aura be brought down, it returns automatically as a free action on the bandersnatch's next turn. Magicbane bandersnatches lack gaze and quick recovery.
Primal Bandersnatch (+2 CR): Primal bandersnatches have kept their ties to the ancient world of the fey. They have the extraplanar subtype, SR equal to 11 plus their CR, DR:10/cold iron, and the advanced creature simple template.

#BOG NIXIES - In some lands, nixies are evil creatures who lead folk to drown in their waters, either by captivating their targets with song or by assuming the form of an animal or humanoid and tricking a hunter or explorer into dangerous waters. These evil nixies prefer dwelling in festering swamps or blighted fens, and are typically known as bog nixies. The fact that a bog nixie can grant minor wishes, ironically, only increases their opportunities for evil, as brave or foolish explorers deliberately seek them out. A bog nixie is a neutral evil nixie with the advanced creature template who has the following additional powers. A bog nixie's CR is +2 higher than a normal nixie's.

Bog Nixie	BONUS:MISC|CR|2
Captivating Song (Su): This works like the harpy ability of the same name. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Change Shape (Su): This works as polymorph, and allows the bog nixie to assume the form of any size Small or Medium aquatic animal or humanoid.
Minor Wish (Sp): Once per day, a bog nixie can create a magical effect in exchange for a gift or service from a humanoid. The power of this "wish" is no greater than what can be done with a 3rd-level spell.
