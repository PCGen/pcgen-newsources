VARIANT BANDERSNATCHES
Though no bandersnatch is ordinary, some are
rarer than others. The most famous
is the frumious bandersnatch,
brimming with rage so fierce it
burns. Variant bandersnatches
may combine two or more
of the abilities below.
Confounding Bandersnatch (+1 CR): Confounding
bandersnatches drip infectious madness from their
quills and Claws. Poison (Ex) Claws and quills-injury;
save Fort DC 29
frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes
effect
confused for 1 minute
cure 2 consecutive saves. The save
DC is Constitution-based.
Frumious Bandersnatch (+2 CR): A frumious
bandersnatch seethes with barely repressed rage and anger.
If it misses with its Bite attack or falls below half of its hit
points, it succumbs to such uncontrollable fury that it bursts
into f lame. While engulfed in these f lames, a frumious
bandersnatch is affected as by a haste spell (this effect
cannot be dispelled) and causes an additional 2d6 points
of fire damage with each of its melee attacks and its quill
defense ability. The fury lasts for 5 rounds, after which the
bandersnatch cannot enter a fury again for another 5 rounds.
A frumious bandersnatch has fire resistance 30.
Lesser Bandersnatch (-4 CR): Smaller or younger
bandersnatches are still fearsome predators in their
own right. A lesser bandersnatch is Huge, with 4 fewer
Hit Dice than a typical bandersnatch. Reduce its physical
ability scores by 4 each and its Wisdom and Charisma by
2 each. A lesser bandersnatch lacks quick recovery and
deals 1d8+4 points of damage with its quill defense and
pain abilities. Lesser bandersnatches never have any
additional variant powers.
Magicbane Bandersnatch (+3 CR): These bandersnatches
radiate an antimagic aura in a 20-foot radius. Should
the aura be brought down, it returns automatically as a
free action on the bandersnatch's next turn. Magicbane
bandersnatches lack gaze and quick recovery.
Primal Bandersnatch (+2 CR): Primal bandersnatches
have kept their ties to the ancient world of the fey.
They have the extraplanar subtype,
SR equal to 11 plus their CR, 
	DR:10/
cold iron, and the advanced creature
simple template.

#BOG NIXIES
In some lands, nixies are evil creatures who lead folk to
drown in their waters, either by captivating their targets
with song or by assuming the form of an animal or
humanoid and tricking a hunter or explorer into dangerous
waters. These evil nixies prefer dwelling in festering
swamps or blighted fens, and are typically known as bog
nixies. The fact that a bog nixie can grant minor wishes,
ironically, only increases their opportunities for evil, as
brave or foolish explorers deliberately seek them out.
A bog nixie is a neutral evil nixie with the advanced
creature template who has the following additional
powers. A bog nixie's
	CR:is +2 higher than a normal nixie's.
Captivating Song (Su): This works like the harpy ability
of the same name. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Change Shape (Su): This works as polymorph, and allows
the bog nixie to assume the form of any
	SIZE:S
	or Medium
aquatic animal or humanoid.
Minor Wish (Sp): Once per day, a bog
nixie can create a magical effect in
exchange for a gift or service from
a humanoid. The power of this
"wish" is no greater than what can
be done with a 3rd-level spell.
