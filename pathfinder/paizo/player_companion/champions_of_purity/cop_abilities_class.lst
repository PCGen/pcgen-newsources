###Block: Cleric Domain Powers
# Redemption Subdomain
Aura of Sanctification		KEY:Redemption Subdomain ~ Aura of Sanctification		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.DomainPower		DESC:At 8th level, as an immediate action, you can emit a 30-foot-radius aura of sanctification for a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. Within this aura, effects that are specifically harmful to good-aligned creatures are inverted so that they no longer harm good creatures and instead harm evil creatures. Similarly, effects that are specifically beneficial to evil creatures instead become beneficial only to good creatures.				SOURCEPAGE:p.21
