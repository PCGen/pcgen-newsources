Wall of Ashes			KEY:Wall of Ashes ~ Ash Subdomain				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.DomainPower									DESC:At 8th level, you can create a wall of swirling ashes anywhere within 100 feet. This wall is up to %1 feet high and up to %2 feet long. The wall of ash blocks line of sight, and any creature passing through it must make a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. The wall of ash reveals invisible creatures that are inside it or adjacent to it, although they become invisible again if they move away from the wall. You can use this ability for %3 minutes per day, but these minutes do not need to be consecutive.|DomainLVL*20|DomainLVL*10|DomainLVL																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.86

Call Fire (Su): As a standard action, you can stretch out
your hand toward any visible fire source within 60 feet and
beckon it toward you. This causes a ribbon-thin streak of
fire to approach you in a straight line through the air. Any
creature directly in the fire ribbon’s path takes 1d4 points of
fire damage; a successful Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your cleric
level + your Wisdom modifier) negates this damage. When
the ribbon of fire reaches your hand, it either extinguishes
or lights a flammable object of your choice that you’re
holding. You can use this ability a number of times per day
equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.
Replacement Domain Spells: 2nd—flaming sphere, 5th—
flame strike, 7th—delayed blast fireball.


Body of Ice				KEY:Body of Ice ~ Ice Subdomain				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.DomainPower									DESC:At 8th level, you can transmute your body and equipment to ice for a period of time. It takes a standard action to take on the form of ice, and you can end the transmutation with a free action on your turn. When you take on the form of ice, you are immune to cold and have DR 5/-, but you take twice the normal amount of damage from fire. You can take on the form of ice %1 rounds per day. The rounds need not be consecutive.|DomainLVL																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.92

Sift (Su): Once per day at 6th level you can reach into
water as a standard action and pull out an object with
a maximum gp value of up to 50 gp  your cleric level.
This object always has the broken condition upon being
withdrawn from the water. The water you reach into must
be at least deep enough to fully immerse yourself. At 12th
level, objects you retrieve are not broken. At 20th level you
can retrieve objects worth up to 5,000 gp. If retrieving an
object which would not normally float, assume it rests on
top of, or is entwined with, debris that does float. Objects
retrieved in this manner disappear after 24 hours if they
haven’t yet been used up or otherwise destroyed.
Replacement Domain Spells: 2nd—make whole, 5th—
major creation, 6th—animate object.


Command				KEY:Command ~ Inevitable Subdomain				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.DomainPower									DESC:As a standard action, you can give a creature an emotionless yet undeniable order, as per the spell command. A Will save negates this effect. You cannot target a creature more than once per day with this ability. You can use this ability %1 times per day.|3+WIS																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.92

Master’s Yoke (Su): At 8th level you can attempt to
assert your dominance over any visible creature within
30 feet by declaring the target your property. The target
can resist this effect with a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your
cleric level + your Wisdom modifier). If the target fails the
save, it is affected as if by dominate monster for a number of
rounds equal to 1/2 your cleric level, save that the target
can choose to ignore any order you give and instead take 2
points of Constitution damage and become staggered for
1 round. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level,
and an additional time per day for every four levels beyond
8th. This is a language-based mind-affecting effect.
Replacement Domain Spells: 1st—charm person, 5th—
dominate person, 8th—binding.


Deadly Weather			KEY:Deadly Weather ~ Catastrophe Subdomain		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.DomainPower									DESC:At 8th level, you can unleash a furious call to the heavens, summoning forth an everchanging storm of destruction %1 rounds per day. This storm has a radius of %2 feet. Each round, the storm has one of the following effects: driving rain (-4 on all Perception checks and ranged attack rolls), howling winds (-8 on Fly skill checks and ranged attack rolls), heavy snow (all terrain is considered difficult), or lightning bolt (as call lightning). Other effects depending on the weather might also apply (at the GM's discretion). You choose which effect takes place each round, but no effect may be repeated on the following round. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.|DomainLVL|DomainLVL*5																									SOURCEPAGE:p.87

Painful Smite (Su): Prior to making a melee attack roll,
you can choose to convert all damage from that strike into
nonlethal damage, adding your Wisdom modifier to the
damage. If you succeed in your attack, you can make an
Intimidate check against your target to demoralize them
as a free action. You gain a bonus on your Intimidate check
equal to the nonlethal damage dealt by the painful strike.
You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to
3 + your Wisdom modifier.
Replacement Domain Spells: 2nd—pain strike*, 5th—
symbol of pain, 8th—demand.
