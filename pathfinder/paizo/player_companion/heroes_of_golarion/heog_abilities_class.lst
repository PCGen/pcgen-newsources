Speaker of the Palatine Eye		KEY:Bard Archetype ~ Speaker of the Palatine Eye			CATEGORY:Archetype			TYPE:Archetype.BardArchetype					SOURCEPAGE:p.8				DESC:Working from the shadows of Ustalav’s high society, the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye is a mystical cult built around the quest for immortality. Founded by a count who claimed  to  have been enlightened by angels, the Order follows a strict hierarchy, and membership is open only to the elite. The more money a member provides the Order, the more secrets he learns to aid his path toward angelic ascension. More information on the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye can be found in Pathfinder Adventure Path 44: Trial of the Beast. &nl; A speaker of the Palatine Eye influences others using his occult knowledge rather than the boisterous enthusiasm of most bards. He must be a worshipper of Pharasma, but he may worship additional deities as well.
