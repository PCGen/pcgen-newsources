When you create a rune, pick one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire.  While the rune is active, the next creature other than you who steps on or touches the rune's area causes the rune to explode. The rune's explosion deals a number of points of energy damage equal to 1d81 to anything in its square. A Reflex saving throw halves the damage (DC %1 The rune is considered a magical trap for the purpose of perceiving it or disabling it) The DC for both Perception and Disable Device checks is the same as the Reflex saving throw to halve the damage. You can use this ability %2 times per day.  Each rune lasts for 24 hours or until discharged. As a swift action, you may spend 1 point from your arcane pool to increase potency of any runes scribed for %3 rounds.

In addition, you take a %5 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants you %6 hit points, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in bloodrage, you cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.

Awesome Blow			KEY:Brawler ~ Awesome Blow			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BrawlerClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	DESC:You can deal a powerful blow that sends an enemy reeling.	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:The brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler's choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can't move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent's move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)
Improved Awesome Blow	KEY:Brawler ~ Improved Awesome Blow			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BrawlerClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	DESC:You have improved your ability to deliver awesome blows.	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:The brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a standard action. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.

She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk's robe).

These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus combat feat. Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus combat feat for the level.

Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual power more than once.																												BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Rage Power|RagePowersLVL/3										BONUS:VAR|RagePowersPrereqLVL|RagePowersLVL
Spell Kenning		KEY:Skald ~ Spell Kenning			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkaldClassAbility.SkaldSpellKenning.Supernatural																						DESC:At 5th level, a skald is learned in the magic of other spellcasters, and can use his own magic to duplicate those classes' spells. Once per day, a skald can cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were one of his skald's spells known, expending a skald spell slot of an appropriate level to cast the spell. Casting a spell with spell kenning always has a minimum casting time of 1 full round, regardless of the casting time of the spell. At 11th level, a skald can use this ability twice per day.

Damage Reduction		KEY:Skald ~ Damage Reduction			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkaldClassAbility.SkaldDamageReduction.Extraordinary																					DESC:At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th level this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0. The skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his raging song.
Dirge of Doom		KEY:Skald ~ Dirge of Doom			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkaldClassAbility.SkaldDirgeOfDoom.Supernatural																						DESC:At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This works like raging song and expends rounds of raging song, but it only affects enemies within 30 feet who are able to hear the skald's performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and it relies on audible components. A skald may not use dirge of doom and raging song simultaneously.
Master Skald		KEY:Skald ~ Master Skald			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkaldClassAbility.SkaldMasterSkald.Supernatural																						DESC:At 20th level, a skald's raging song no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills, abilities, or rage powers they can use.

She can even use this ability with thrown light or one-handed piercing melee weapons, so long as the target is within 30 feet of her. Any creature that is immune to sneak attacks is immune to the additional damage granted by precise strike, and any item or ability that protects a creature from critical hits also protects a creature from the additional damage of a precise strike. This additional damage is precision damage, and isn't multiplied on a critical hit. As a swift action, a swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point to deal %2 additional damage instead. This benefit must be used before the end of her turn, or it is lost.

This combination of two distinct bloodlines can create a versatile and powerful rager who stands out among the horde. A crossblooded rager selects two different bloodlines. He gains access to the feats, bonus spells, and some of the powers of both bloodlines he is descended from, but at the cost of reducing mental clarity (see Drawbacks below). If the crossblooded rager already has a bloodline from another class, one of the chosen bloodlines must be that bloodline.

Bonus Feats		KEY:Crossblooded Rager ~ Bonus Feats		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bloodrager ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:A crossblooded rager combines the bonus feat lists from both of his bloodlines and can select his bloodline bonus feats from this combined list.

Bonus Spells	KEY:Crossblooded Rager ~ Bonus Spells		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bloodrager ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:A crossblooded rager can select his bonus spells from either of his bloodlines. He can also learn a lower-level bonus spell he did not choose in place of the higher-level bonus spell he would normally gain. Lowerlevel bonus spells learned in this manner are always the spell level that they would be if the crossblooded rager had learned them with the appropriate bonus spell. For example: A 7th-level aberrant/abyssal crossblooded rager has the choice of learning enlarge person or ray of enfeeblement as his bloodline bonus spell. If he selected ray of enfeeblement as his 7th-level bonus spell, at 10th level he could use his new bonus spell to learn enlarge person instead of bull's strength or see invisibility, and he would add it to his list of 1st-level spells known ( just as if he had learned it as his 7th-level bonus spell).

Drawbacks		KEY:Crossblooded Rager ~ Drawbacks			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bloodrager ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:The furious mix of arcane power inside a crossblooded rager forces him to constantly expend mental effort to remain focused on his current situation and needs. This leaves him with less mental resolve available to deal with external threats. A crossblooded rager takes a –2 penalty to all Will saving throws at all times, and does not gain the +2 morale bonus on Will saving throws while bloodraging—though he does gain a +1 morale bonus Will saving throws when he gains the greater bloodrage class feature, which increases to a +2 morale bonus on saving throws upon gaining the mighty bloodrage class feature.

Orisons			KEY:Warpriest ~ Orisons			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WarpriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DESC:You can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they are not expended when used and may be used again.																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Spontaneous Casting	KEY:Warpriest ~ Spontaneous Casting	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WarpriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DESC:You can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that you did not prepare ahead of time.			BENEFIT:You can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that you did not prepare ahead of time. You can "lose" any prepared spell that is not an orison or domain spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with "Cure" in its name).
Weapon Focus		KEY:Warpriest ~ Weapon Focus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WarpriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 1st level, a warpriest receives Weapon Focus as a bonus feat (choosing any weapon, not just his deity's favored weapon). If his deity's favored weapon is unarmed strike, he can instead select Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat.	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Weapon Focus|1
Blessings			KEY:Warpriest ~ Blessings				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WarpriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DESC:Blessings (Su): A warpriest's deity influences his alignment, what magic he can perform, his values, and how others see him. Each warpriest can select two blessings from among those granted by his deity (each deity grants the blessings tied to its domains). A warpriest can select an alignment blessing (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his alignment matches that domain. If a warpriest isn't devoted to a particular deity, he still selects two blessings to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities, subject to GM approval. He can call upon the power of his blessings %1 times per day. The DC for these blessings is: %2|(TL/2)+3|(TL/2)+10+WIS		BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Warpriest Blessing|2
Sacred Weapon		KEY:Warpriest ~ Sacred Weapon			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WarpriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DESC:Sacred Weapon (Su): Weapons wielded by a warpriest are charged with the power of his faith. In addition to the favored weapon of his deity, the warpriest can designate a weapon as a sacred weapon by selecting that weapon with the Weapon Focus feat (if he has multiple Weapon Focus feats, this ability applies to all of them). Whenever the warpriest is wielding a sacred weapon, he treats his warpriest level as his base attack bonus for attacks made with that weapon, stacking with any base attack bonus from other classes or racial Hit Dice. In addition, the warpriest sacred weapon damage is based on his level and not the weapon type. The damage for Medium warpriests is listed on Table 1–13. If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This increase in damage does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The warpriest can decide to use the weapon’s base damage instead of the sacred weapon damage—this must be declared before the attack roll is made. At 4th level, the warpriest gains the ability to imbue his sacred weapon with divine power as a swift action. This power grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every four levels beyond 4th, this bonus increases by +1 to a maximum of +5 at 20th level. These bonuses stack with any existing bonuses the weapon might have, to a maximum of +5. The warpriest can imbue a weapon with any of the following weapon properties: brilliant energy, defending, disruption, flaming, frost,  keen, and  shock. In addition, if the warpriest is chaotic, he can add anarchicand vicious. If he is evil, he can add mighty cleavingand unholy. If he is good, he can add holyand merciful. If he is lawful, he can add axiomaticand ghost touch. Adding any of these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the properties base cost (see Table 15– 9 of the Core Rulebook). Duplicate abilities do not stack. The weapon must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus before any other properties can be added, whether normally from itself or granted by this ability.  The warpriest can use this ability one round per day per warpriest level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive. The enhancement bonus and properties are determined the f irst time the ability is used each day, and cannot be changed until the ability is used again the next day. These bonuses only apply while the warpriest is holding the weapon, and end immediately if the weapon is sheathed or leaves the warpriest’s possession. This ability can be ended as a free action at the start of the warpriest’s turn (and that round does not count against the total duration, unless the ability is resumed). If the warpriest uses this ability on a double weapon, the effects only apply to one end the weapon.
Sacred Armor		KEY:Warpriest ~ Sacred Armor			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WarpriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DESC:Sacred Armor (Su): At 7th level, the warpriest gains the ability to imbue his armor with divine power as a swift action. This power grants the armor a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 7th, this bonus increases by +1, to a maximum of +5 at 19th level. These bonuses stack with any existing bonuses the armor might have, to a maximum of +5. The warpriest can imbue armor any of the following armor properties: energy resistance(normal, improved, and greater), fortification (heavy, light, or moderate), glamered, and spell resistance (13, 15, 17, and 19). Adding any of these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the properties base cost (see Table 15–4 of the Core Rulebook). For this purpose, glamered counts as a +1, energy resistancecounts as +2, improved energy resistance counts as +4, and greater energy resistancecounts as +5. Duplicate abilities do not stack. The armor must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus before any other properties can be added, whether normally from itself or granted by this ability. The warpriest can use this ability one minute per day per warpriest level, but these minutes do not need to be consecutive. The enhancement bonus and properties are determined the first time the ability is used each day and cannot be changed until the ability is used again the next day. These bonuses only apply while the warpriest is wearing the armor, and end immediately if the armor is removed or leaves the warpriest's possession. This ability can be ended as a free action at the start of the warpriest's turn. This ability cannot be applied to a shield.
Bonus Feats		KEY:Warpriest ~ Bonus Feats		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WarpriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 3rd level, and at every three levels thereafter, a warpriest gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called "fighter bonus feats."				BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Warpriest Bonus Feat|WarpriestLvl/3
Fervor			KEY:Warpriest ~ Fervor				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WarpriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DESC:Fervor (Su): Starting at 2nd level, the warpriest can draw upon the power of his faith to heal wounds (%1D6) or harm foes. This is a standard action, unless used on himself then it is a swift action. He can also use this ability to quickly cast spells that aid in his struggles at the cost of one use of this ability. This ability can be used %2 times per day.|(TL/3)+1|(TL/2)+CHA
