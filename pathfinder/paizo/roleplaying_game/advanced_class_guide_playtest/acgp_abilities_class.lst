This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack). Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual power more than once.

Spell Kenning					KEY:Skald ~ Spell Kenning					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkaldClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SkaldSpellKenning.Supernatural			DESC:At 5th level, a skald is learned in the magic of other spellcasters, and can use his own magic to duplicate those classes' spells. Once per day, a skald can cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were one of his skald's spells known, expending a skald spell slot of an appropriate level to cast the spell. Casting a spell with spell kenning always has a minimum casting time of 1 full round, regardless of the casting time of the spell. At 11th level, a skald can use this ability twice per day. At 17th level, he can use this ability three times per day.

Dirge of Doom					KEY:Skald ~ Dirge of Doom					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkaldClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SkaldDirgeOfDoom.Supernatural			DESC:At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This works like raging song and expends rounds of raging song, but it only affects enemies within 30 feet who are able to hear the skald's performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and it relies on audible components. A skald may not use dirge of doom and raging song simultaneously.
Master Skald					KEY:Skald ~ Master Skald					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkaldClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SkaldMasterSkald.Supernatural			DESC:At 20th level, a skald's raging song no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills, abilities, or rage powers they can use.
