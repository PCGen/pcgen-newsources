Orisons			KEY:Warpriest ~ Orisons			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WarpriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DESC:You can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they are not expended when used and may be used again.																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Spontaneous Casting	KEY:Warpriest ~ Spontaneous Casting	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WarpriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DESC:You can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that you did not prepare ahead of time.			BENEFIT:You can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that you did not prepare ahead of time. You can "lose" any prepared spell that is not an orison or domain spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with "Cure" in its name).
Weapon Focus		KEY:Warpriest ~ Weapon Focus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WarpriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 1st level, a warpriest receives Weapon Focus as a bonus feat (choosing any weapon, not just his deity's favored weapon). If his deity's favored weapon is unarmed strike, he can instead select Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat.	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Weapon Focus|1
Blessings			KEY:Warpriest ~ Blessings				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WarpriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DESC:Blessings (Su): A warpriest's deity influences his alignment, what magic he can perform, his values, and how others see him. Each warpriest can select two blessings from among those granted by his deity (each deity grants the blessings tied to its domains). A warpriest can select an alignment blessing (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his alignment matches that domain. If a warpriest isn't devoted to a particular deity, he still selects two blessings to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities, subject to GM approval. He can call upon the power of his blessings %1 times per day. The DC for these blessings is: %2|(TL/2)+3|(TL/2)+10+WIS		BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Warpriest Blessing|2
Sacred Weapon		KEY:Warpriest ~ Sacred Weapon			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WarpriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DESC:Sacred Weapon (Su): Weapons wielded by a warpriest are charged with the power of his faith. In addition to the favored weapon of his deity, the warpriest can designate a weapon as a sacred weapon by selecting that weapon with the Weapon Focus feat (if he has multiple Weapon Focus feats, this ability applies to all of them). Whenever the warpriest is wielding a sacred weapon, he treats his warpriest level as his base attack bonus for attacks made with that weapon, stacking with any base attack bonus from other classes or racial Hit Dice. In addition, the warpriest sacred weapon damage is based on his level and not the weapon type. The damage for Medium warpriests is listed on Table 1-13. If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This increase in damage does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The warpriest can decide to use the weapon's base damage instead of the sacred weapon damage-this must be declared before the attack roll is made. At 4th level, the warpriest gains the ability to imbue his sacred weapon with divine power as a swift action. This power grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every four levels beyond 4th, this bonus increases by +1 to a maximum of +5 at 20th level. These bonuses stack with any existing bonuses the weapon might have, to a maximum of +5. The warpriest can imbue a weapon with any of the following weapon properties: brilliant energy, defending, disruption, flaming, frost,  keen, and  shock. In addition, if the warpriest is chaotic, he can add anarchicand vicious. If he is evil, he can add mighty cleavingand unholy. If he is good, he can add holyand merciful. If he is lawful, he can add axiomaticand ghost touch. Adding any of these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the properties base cost (see Table 15- 9 of the Core Rulebook). Duplicate abilities do not stack. The weapon must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus before any other properties can be added, whether normally from itself or granted by this ability.  The warpriest can use this ability one round per day per warpriest level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive. The enhancement bonus and properties are determined the f irst time the ability is used each day, and cannot be changed until the ability is used again the next day. These bonuses only apply while the warpriest is holding the weapon, and end immediately if the weapon is sheathed or leaves the warpriest's possession. This ability can be ended as a free action at the start of the warpriest's turn (and that round does not count against the total duration, unless the ability is resumed). If the warpriest uses this ability on a double weapon, the effects only apply to one end the weapon.
Sacred Armor		KEY:Warpriest ~ Sacred Armor			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WarpriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DESC:Sacred Armor (Su): At 7th level, the warpriest gains the ability to imbue his armor with divine power as a swift action. This power grants the armor a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 7th, this bonus increases by +1, to a maximum of +5 at 19th level. These bonuses stack with any existing bonuses the armor might have, to a maximum of +5. The warpriest can imbue armor any of the following armor properties: energy resistance(normal, improved, and greater), fortification (heavy, light, or moderate), glamered, and spell resistance (13, 15, 17, and 19). Adding any of these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the properties base cost (see Table 15-4 of the Core Rulebook). For this purpose, glamered counts as a +1, energy resistancecounts as +2, improved energy resistance counts as +4, and greater energy resistancecounts as +5. Duplicate abilities do not stack. The armor must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus before any other properties can be added, whether normally from itself or granted by this ability. The warpriest can use this ability one minute per day per warpriest level, but these minutes do not need to be consecutive. The enhancement bonus and properties are determined the first time the ability is used each day and cannot be changed until the ability is used again the next day. These bonuses only apply while the warpriest is wearing the armor, and end immediately if the armor is removed or leaves the warpriest's possession. This ability can be ended as a free action at the start of the warpriest's turn. This ability cannot be applied to a shield.
Bonus Feats		KEY:Warpriest ~ Bonus Feats		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WarpriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 3rd level, and at every three levels thereafter, a warpriest gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called "fighter bonus feats."				BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Warpriest Bonus Feat|WarpriestLvl/3
Fervor			KEY:Warpriest ~ Fervor				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WarpriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DESC:Fervor (Su): Starting at 2nd level, the warpriest can draw upon the power of his faith to heal wounds (%1D6) or harm foes. This is a standard action, unless used on himself then it is a swift action. He can also use this ability to quickly cast spells that aid in his struggles at the cost of one use of this ability. This ability can be used %2 times per day.|(TL/3)+1|(TL/2)+CHA
