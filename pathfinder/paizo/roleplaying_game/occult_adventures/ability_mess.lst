###Block: Occult Rituals
209
AVOIDANCE WARD
School enchantment (compulsion); Level 4
Casting Time 40 minutes
Components V, M (a piece of rowan wood charcoal), F (a small
silver mirror worth 50 gp)
Skill Checks Knowledge (dungeoneering) DC 30, 3 successes;
Spellcraft DC 30, 1 success
Range touch
Target one dungeon door
Duration 8 hours
Saving Throw Will negates (harmless, object); SR yes
(harmless, object)
Backlash The caster takes 4d6 points of damage.
Failure The target door swings open and cannot be closed by
the caster by any means short of a limited wish for 24 hours.
EFFECT
The caster begins by placing a mirror on one side of the door and writing occult symbols on the other side of the door that conform to one type or subtype of creature on the ranger's favored enemy list (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 64). Upon completion of the ritual, creatures of the chosen type or subtype cannot open, touch, or even magically manipulate the door by any means (with no save or spell resistance applicable). A dungeon door can have only one avoidance ward at a time.
BREACH THE VEIL OF DREAMS
School conjuration (creation); Level 6
Casting Time 60 minutes
Components V, S, M (incenses burned in a bowl filled with
grave earth, a bottle of wormwood wine for each caster), F
(an ornate silver and mithral key worth 5,000 gp), SC (up to
the Intelligence modifier of the primary caster)
Skill Checks Knowledge (arcana) DC 32, 3 successes;
Knowledge (planes) DC 32, 3 successes
Range touch
Duration instantaneous; see text
Saving Throw none; SR no
Backlash The primary caster takes 2d6 points of damage and
becomes exhausted.
Failure An animate dream (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 29)
appears at the site of the ritual and attacks the casters. At the
GM's discretion, the animate dream may have the advanced
template, be accompanied by fellow animate dreams, or both.
EFFECT
This ritual must be cast at night on the Material Plane. The casters drink the wormwood wine and begin chanting the incantation as the incense burns. The casters mix the ashes with the grave earth and use the mixture to draw a threshold with a keyhole. They then insert the key into this door as the incantation is completed. Success indicates the casters pass through the portal and enter a random location on the Dimension of Dreams. If the casters wish to return to the Material Plane from the Dimension of Dreams, each must succeed at a DC 35 concentration check to do so. This is a full-round action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. The DC of this check is reduced by 1 for every 2d6 points of damage the traveler willingly takes from psychic and physical trauma as part of the full-round action (this damage can't be reduced in any way). If successful, the caster is transported back to the site of the ritual's casting of the Material Plane. The casters can try again if they fail their concentration checks. A caster can use her character level + her Charisma modifier as her bonus on the concentration check if she isn't a spellcaster or if that value is higher than her usual concentration bonus.

CALL BEYOND THE VEIL
School conjuration (calling); Level 6
Casting Time 60 minutes
Components V, S, F (either an object once possessed by the
spirit or entity called, or the name of the spirit or entity
called), SC (up to 8)
Skill Checks Diplomacy DC 31, 2 successes; Knowledge (religion)
DC 33, 3 successes; Knowledge (planes) DC 33, 1 success
Range primary caster
Effect call on the spirit of a single deceased creature or a
psychic entity
Duration concentration of the primary caster
Saving Throw Will negates; SR no
Backlash All casters become exhausted and gain 1 temporary
negative level (DC = 16 + primary caster's Charisma bonus to
remove after the first day).
Failure All casters gain 1 permanent negative level and are
exhausted until that negative level is removed.
EFFECT
The primary caster attempts to compel the spirit of a specific individual or a psychic entity to manifest from its final rest or extraplanar location. Unwilling spirits or entities can resist the summons by succeeding at a Will save. If a spirit or entity succeeds at the saving throw, it doesn't manifest, but the ritual is still considered a success. Spirits or entities that fail or forgo this save are summoned into the primary caster's body, where they speak by way of the caster's voice, which takes on an otherworldly timbre. Though the spirit or entity speaks through the primary caster, it has no further control of that caster's mind or body, and can't use any spells, spell-like abilities, or even purely mental supernatural abilities it may have. It must leave the primary caster when that caster ends his concentration. While the spirit is speaking through the primary caster, the secondary casters can ask it questions at a maximum rate of 1 question per round (regardless of the number of secondary casters). The spirit or entity speaks in a language it knows or knew while it was alive, and can refuse to answer questions or attempt to deceive its questioners and the primary caster using Bluff. It is not otherwise beholden to the ritual casters.

211

ENSNARING CIRCLE
School abjuration [variable; see text]; Level 4
Casting Time 40 minutes
Components V, S, M (powdered silver), F (a stylus made of
mithral and diamond worth 5,000 gp), SC (up to 8)
Skill Checks Knowledge (planes) DC 30, 2 successes; Knowledge
(religion) DC 30, 1 success; Linguistics DC 30, 1 success
Range 10 ft.
Effect a 20-foot-radius magic circle
Duration 1 day/character level of the primary caster
Saving Throw Will negates (harmless); SR no, see text
Backlash The primary caster takes 2d6 points of damage.
Failure The casters believe their work was successful, though
when they attempt to use the circle, nothing occurs.
EFFECT
This ritual requires the casters to create a large magic circle outlined with the silver powder and shaped with the focus stylus. The circle must be painstakingly molded to attune it to the alignment targeted (chaos, evil, good, or law), which is chosen during the time of creation. The ritual gains the descriptor of the alignment selected. Once the circle is complete, it becomes invisible to all but the casters of the ritual or to creatures with see invisibility, true seeing, or some other method of seeing invisible objects. Once the circle is complete, it can be used to trap an outsider whose subtype matches the chosen alignment, as if it were an inward-focused magic circle spell of the appropriate type (thus, an ensnaring circle attuned to evil acts like an inward-focused magic circle against evil). For an outsider to be trapped in this manner, the entire space of the outsider must be within the circle, at which point the primary caster can activate the circle as an immediate action. The primary caster must be within 100 feet of the circle and be able to see it and the outsider he wishes to trap in order to activate the circle. It is possible to trap multiple outsiders of the appropriate subtype in the circle if more than one are in the circle when it is activated. However, if any such outsider is not completely within the circle, it is not caught within the circle's confines and is free to disrupt the circle as described in the magic circle against evil spell description. As with a magic circle, the trapped outsider cannot cross the circle's boundaries or reach over or beyond the boundaries, nor can it disrupt the circle either directly or indirectly, though it can make ranged attacks beyond the circle's boundaries. If the outsider has spell resistance, it can test the trap once per day. If the primary caster fails to overcome the outsider's spell resistance, the circle is disrupted and the outsider is freed from the circle's restraints. An outsider capable of any form of dimensional travel can simply leave the circle using such an ability. Unlike with a magic circle, you cannot create a special diagram when creating the circle to make the ensnaring circle more secure.
ETHEREAL RIP
School evocation; Level 5
Casting Time 50 minutes
Components V, S, M (a dollop of ectoplasm and paste extracted
from ground lotus root worth 500 gp), F (an obsidian dagger
with at least a +2 enhancement bonus and the ghost touch
special weapon ability, worth at least 18,301 gp)
Skill Checks Knowledge (planes) DC 29, 3 successes;
Knowledge (geography) DC 29, 2 successes
Range touch
Effect a rip between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane
Duration 1 hour/primary caster's character level and
instantaneous; see text
Saving Throw Reflex negates; SR no
Backlash The caster takes 4d6 points of damage.
Failure The caster gains the incorporeal subtype and is confused
for 24 hours.
EFFECT
Upon this ritual's completion, the focus dagger is imbued with the power to cut a momentary rift between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane, though only if the caster adheres to the restrictions of the ritual. At the ritual's start, the caster must find the perfect spot for such an incision: a place where the features of the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane are closely aligned (the exact spot is determined by the GM). Then, after mumbling an incantation that weakens the borders of those two planes at that location, the caster must evenly coat the entire focus blade with a mixture of the material components. When that is compete, the ritual is successful and the backlash occurs, but the ritual's true effect can be delayed. As long as the caster does not move from her space, and does not stop holding the focus dagger, she can use the dagger to cut into the weakened border between the two planes as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, but she must do so within 1 hour per character level after successfully completing the ritual and taking the backlash. Doing so has an immediate and dramatic effect-the rip attempts to suck all creatures and unattended objects within 30 feet of the caster's space that weigh less than 200 pounds into either the Ethereal Plane (if the rip is made on the Material Plane) or the Material Plane (if the rip is made on the Ethereal Plane). With a successful Reflex save, a creature avoids the rip's pull. Creatures and objects pulled into the rift land in a corresponding space on the other plane. The ritual caster can choose whether she wants to be sucked through the rift or stay on the plane where she cast the ritual.

212

HAUNTED COMMUNION
School necromancy; Level 7
Casting Time 70 minutes
Components V, S, M (special paints and a small, salted pastry),
F (silver bell worth 500 gp), SC (up to 18)
Skill Checks Knowledge (arcana) DC 31, 3 successes; Knowledge
(religion) DC 31, 3 successes, Linguistics DC 31, 1 success
Range touch
Target one haunt within 60 feet
Duration 1 hour and 10 rounds (D); see text
Saving Throw Will negates; SR yes
Backlash The primary caster is exhausted.
Failure The casters take 1 permanent negative level and a
-4 penalty on all skill and ability checks for as long as the
negative level persists.
EFFECT
This ritual must be performed within 60 feet of a haunt. The primary caster rings the silver bell using an object associated with the haunt's origin or source of power. Once this is done, the primary caster draws an intricate circle adorned with occult symbols around a plate bearing the small, salted pastry. If the incantation is successful, the haunt's spirit enters into the pastry (making the haunt inert for the duration of the ritual) and one of the casters must eat the pastry before the next hour or the ritual ends. Failure to do so allows the haunt to go free and increases any DCs of the haunt's effects by 4 and grants a +4 bonus on attack rolls made by the haunt for 24 hours. Once a caster eats the pastry, the spirit of the haunt speaks through the individual who ate the pastry, and is required to truthfully answer 10 questions (1 question per round) before departing, though since the haunt is an emotional echo, the answers may be brief, cryptic, or repetitive, as with speak with dead. Once the 10 questions are answered or the spell is dismissed, the haunt can manifest as normal.
OPENING THE THIRD EYE
School transmutation; Level 5
Casting Time 50 minutes
Components V, S, M (incense), SC (up to 12)
Skill Checks Knowledge (arcana) DC 34, 3 successes; Knowledge
(planes) DC 34, 1 success; Perception DC 34, 1 success
Range touch
Target primary and secondary casters
Duration 1 day (D)
Saving Throw Fortitude negates (harmless); SR yes (harmless)
Backlash All casters take 2d6 points of damage.
Failure All casters gain a temporary negative level (DC = 16 +
primary caster's Charisma bonus to remove after the first day),
and the primary caster is afflicted with a more potent version
of the mindfire disease (DC 17; 2 saves; 1d4 Int; 1/day).
EFFECT
Through a ceremony of meditation and recitation, the casters of this ritual become psychically attuned. Casters who don't have levels in an occult class gain the following benefits.  *  Each caster can choose one knack from the psychic class's spell list and an additional knack for every 5 character levels that caster possesses (to a maximum of 5 knacks at 20th level). The casters can cast these knacks at will.  *  If a caster is trained in a skill with an occult skill unlock, she can use that skill's occult unlock. Casters who do have levels in an occult base class gain the following benefits.  *  If a caster is trained in a skill with an occult skill unlock, she gains a +4 insight bonus on checks with that skill when using its occult skill unlock.  *  If a caster is untrained in a skill with an occult skill unlock, she can still use that skill's occult unlock. Each of the ritual's casters can choose to dismiss this ritual's effects for themselves individually.
PSYCHIC SHIELDING
School abjuration; Level 6
Casting Time 60 minutes
Components V, S, M (diamond dust worth 500 gp), F (mithral
mirrors worth a total of 10,000 gp and a lit lantern)
Skill Checks Knowledge (arcana) DC 33, 3 successes; Spellcraft
DC 33, 3 successes
Range touch
Target one creature
Duration 1 day/character level of the caster
Saving Throw Will negates (harmless); SR yes (harmless)
Backlash The caster takes 2d6 points of damage and is exhausted.
Failure The caster takes 1 permanent negative level.
EFFECT
The caster must begin this incantation at dusk or dawn, in a windowless room with the intended target (if it is not the caster), surrounded by mithral mirrors pointed inward. As the ritual concludes, the caster blows out a lantern using the diamond dust, leaving her and the target in the darkened room. While in the darkness, the caster must touch the ritual's target before exiting the room. Then, for a number of days equal to the caster's character level, the target gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against psychic spells and abilities, but can't use any psychic magic abilities, can't cast psychic spells or use psychic magic, and can't be engaged or engage in a psychic duel.
RITUAL EXORCISM
School abjuration; Level 4
Casting Time 40 minutes
Components V, S, M (vial of holy water), F (silver holy symbol),
SC (up to 12)
Skill Checks Knowledge (religion) DC 28, 2 successes; Spellcraft
DC 28, 2 successes
Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./character level of the primary caster)
Target one helpless possessed creature or a restrained
possessed object
Duration instantaneous
Saving Throw Will negates; SR yes
Backlash All casters become exhausted.
Failure All casters gain 1 temporary negative level
(DC = 16 + primary caster's Charisma bonus to remove after the
first day), and the primary caster takes 4d6 points of damage.
EFFECT
You force the life force of a possessing creature to leave its host. Upon the completion of this ritual, the possessing creature attempts a Will saving throw. If it fails the save, the possessor is expelled, as if the duration of the spell or effect it used to possess the target had expired. If the possessing creature succeeds at the save, it continues to stay within the host creature or object, though the ritual can be attempted anew as long as the possessed creature is helpless or the object restrained.

213

SEEK ASTRAL INSIGHTS
School divination; Level 6
Casting Time 60 minutes
Components V, S, M (a number of candles made of pure
beeswax equal to the number of wandering stars in
conjunction when the ritual is attempted), F (a mithral chain
worth 5,000 gp), SC (up to 8)
Skill Checks Knowledge (arcana) DC 31, 3 successes;
Knowledge (planes) DC 31, 3 successes
Range primary caster
Duration 1 hour/character level of the primary caster
Backlash The primary caster is rendered speechless for 1 week
(if the ritual fails, this duration begins after the end of the
feeblemind effect).
Failure The primary caster's Intelligence and Charisma scores
drop to 1 and she gains the other effects of a feeblemind
spell for 24 hours.
EFFECT
This ritual can be cast only at midnight on a night when no fewer than three wandering stars (planets) are in conjunction and within view of the casters. The ritual must be performed at the top of a hill, mountain, or other natural vantage point. The primary caster is first wrapped in the focus chains, and the candles are lit in the pattern of the stars in conjunction. The primary caster must sit in complete silence, concentrating on the light of the candles, while the secondary casters circle, chanting the occult incantation. If the ritual is successfully completed, the primary caster's mind is allowed to wander the Astral Plane unhindered, and she can ask one question each hour her mind wanders. The spirits of the Astral Plane answer the caster truthfully, though there is usually only a 60% chance that they will have the answer the primary caster seeks (the chance may be higher or lower at the GM's discretion, depending on the nature of the information sought). If they don't have the answer, the spirits admit that they lack the knowledge the caster seeks rather than trying to deceive her.

214

VEIL STRUCTURE
School illusion (glamer); Level 8
Casting Time 80 minutes
Components V, S, M (a half-gallon of water from a fresh spring
and a potion of invisibility), F (a pair of mithral pitchers and
two golden aspergillums, worth 25,000 gp total), SC (at least
4 and up to 12)
Skill Checks Knowledge (nature or local; see below) DC 32,
4 successes; Spellcraft DC 32, 2 successes; Sleight of Hand
DC 32, 2 successes
Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./character level of the primary caster)
Area one 20-ft. cube/character level of primary caster
Duration permanent (D)
Saving Throw Will disbelief (if interacted with); SR no
Backlash The primary caster takes 1 permanent negative level.
Failure All casters cannot be targeted by any beneficial glamer
effects (such as invisibility) for 1 year (this is a curse effect,
and can be removed with remove curse and similar effects).
EFFECT
The primary caster starts this ritual by placing the fresh spring water in one of the mithral pitchers and the potion of invisibility within the other. The caster then mixes the components of the two pitchers by pouring the water into the pitcher that holds the potion and then transferring the mixed contents back into the pitcher that initially held the water. She then repeats this transference between pitchers six more times, before handing one of the pitchers to one of the secondary casters. In complete silence, the primary caster and the chosen secondary caster use the aspergillums to splash the mixture on a building or structure they wish to veil, which must be no larger than the ritual's area. If the building or structure is in a natural environment, the casters must attempt Knowledge (nature) checks for the ritual. If the building or structure is in an urban environment, they must attempt Knowledge (local) checks. Upon the successful completion of the ritual, the building is veiled, and it appears as if the area were devoid of anything but its natural or urban setting. All of the ritual casters are still able to see the faintest outline of the building and interact with it normally. The primary caster also gains the ability to grant up to 10 creatures per day that she touches the ability to see the faintest outline of the building for a 24-hour period.


# Arcehtypes
# 88
BLOOD KINETICIST (ARCHETYPE)
To a blood kineticist, the water in a creature’s blood is just like
any other sort, and she uses that knowledge to brutal ends.
Blood Focus (Ex): A blood kineticist must choose water as
her primary element and must choose water blast as her first
simple blast. All of her infusions granted by this archetype
work only on targets with blood and automatically fail if the
target is immune to bleed damage.
Wrack (Su): At 1st level, a blood kineticist can use her
abilities to wrack a target within 30 feet, harming the target
by manipulating its blood from the inside. The target takes
half the normal damage of the blood kineticist’s blast,
and can attempt a Fortitude save to reduce that amount to
1/4 normal damage, but the damage is untyped and ignores
damage reduction. This is a 1st-level form infusion that
costs 0 points of burn and can be used with water and blood
blasts. This ability replaces the 1st-level infusion.
Bleeding Infusion (Su): At 5th level, a blood kineticist
can infuse her blasts with a vicious power that causes
internal or external bleeding. On a failed Fortitude save,
the target takes 1 point of bleed damage for every die of
the blast’s damage. A target that fails its saving throw
against the wrack form infusion does not receive a saving
throw to avoid the bleed damage from bleeding infusion
on the same blast. This is a 2nd-level substance infusion
that costs 2 points of burn and can be used with water and
blood blasts. This ability replaces the 5th-level infusion.
Blood Tell (Sp): At 6th level, a blood kineticist’s connection
to blood allows her to learn much from the blood of another.
This works as blood biographyAPG, except the blood kineticist
suddenly knows the information, rather than having it
appear on a parchment. This is a 3rd-level utility wild talent
and costs 0 points of burn. She can accept 1 point of burn
to reduce the casting time to a standard action instead of
1 minute. This ability replaces the 6th-level utility wild talent.
Blood Blast (Su): The first time a blood kineticist selects
water with expanded element, she doesn’t gain the cold
simple blast or the ice composite blast; instead, she gains the
blood composite blast, which costs 2 points of burn. A blood
blast is a physical blast that deals bludgeoning damage. It is
associated with the same infusions as the water blast. If the
blood kineticist selects water with expanded element a second
time, she gains the cold simple blast and ice composite blast
as normal. This ability alters expanded element.
Blood Throw (Su): At 8th level, a blood kineticist gains
the foe throw infusion as a bonus infusion, and can use
it with the water element on water and blood blasts, in
addition to its normal associated element and blast. This
ability replaces the 8th-level utility wild talent.
# 89
Gut-Wrenching Infusion (Su): At 9th level, a blood
kineticist can infuse her blasts with the ability to
manipulate her opponent’s insides to the point of
impairing their function. On a failed Fortitude save, the
target is sickened for 1 minute. A target that fails its saving
throw against the wrack form infusion does not receive
a saving throw to avoid the sickened condition from gutwrenching
infusion on the same blast. This is a 4th-level
substance infusion that costs 3 points of burn and can be
used with water and blood blasts. This ability replaces the
9th-level infusion.
Vampiric Infusion (Su): At 11th level, a blood kineticist can
drain the vitality from her enemy’s blood to restore her own.
If her blast hits (or the enemy fails its saving throw against a
blast without an attack roll) the blood kineticist can activate
the kinetic healer utility wild talent on herself by
accepting its burn cost; she doesn’t need
to take an action to do so. If she doesn’t
possess the kinetic healer utility wild
talent, she can still use this ability,
but it heals only half as much. This
is a 5th-level substance infusion
that costs 3 points of burn and
can be used with water and blood
blasts. This ability replaces the
11th-level infusion.
Blood Mastery (Su): At 20th level,
a blood kineticist no longer ages and
can’t be magically aged. She doesn’t
take penalties to her ability scores
for aging and removes any such penalties
she already possesses. She still accrues age
bonuses as normal, but she doesn’t die of old
age when her time would be up. Because of her
utter control over her own blood, she is immune
to bleed, injected poisons, injury diseases,
and the sickened and nauseated conditions
unless she chooses to be affected. This ability
replaces omnikinesis.

ELEMENTAL ANNIHILATOR
(ARCHETYPE)
For some kineticists, nothing in life is as
sweet as destruction and pain. Elemental
annihilators pursue only uses of their powers
that harm others.
Devastating Infusion (Su): At 1st level, an
elemental annihilator can either shoot her
kinetic blast at a target within 30 feet or make
a single melee attack as if she were using kinetic blade as
an attack action. For this attack, the elemental annihilator’s
base attack bonus from her kineticist levels is equal to her
full kineticist level. A devastating infusion always deals an
amount of damage equal to 1d8 + the elemental annihilator’s
Constitution modifier, regardless of the annihilator’s class
level or use of composite blasts. When making a melee
attack with devastating infusion, the elemental annihilator
doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity, and if she uses two
hands, the attack’s damage is equal to 1d8 + 1-1/2 times her
Constitution modifier. This is a 1st-level form infusion that
costs 0 points of burn and can be used with any physical
blast (but not energy blasts). Unlike with kinetic blade, the
elemental annihilator can use Vital Strike with devastating
infusion. The damage bonus from elemental overf low
doesn’t apply to devastating infusion’s damage rolls. This
ability replaces the 1st-level infusion and the basic utility
wild talent normally granted by selecting an element.
Dampened Versatility (Ex): An elemental annihilator can
never gain utility wild talents.
Bonus Feats: At 2nd level, an elemental
annihilator can select a bonus feat from
the following list: Deadly Aim, Double
Slice, Point-Blank Shot, Power Attack,
Precise Shot, Rapid Shot, Two-
Weapon Fighting, Weapon Finesse,
and Weapon Focus. Rapid Shot
and Two-Weapon Fighting can be
used with a kinetic blast only if the
annihilator also possesses f lurry of
devastation (see below). She gains
an additional bonus feat at 8th,
10th, 14th, and 18th levels. At
8th level, she can also select
Improved Two-Weapon
Fighting and Weapon
Specialization. At 10th
level, she can also select
Greater Weapon Focus,
Improved Critical, Improved
Precise Shot, and Two-Weapon
Rend. An elemental annihilator doesn’t
need to meet the prerequisites for these
feats to select them as bonus feats. This
ability replaces the 2nd-, 8th-, 10th-,
14th-, and 18th-level utility wild talents.
Increased Range (Su): At 3rd level, an
elemental annihilator gains the extended
range infusion. At 9th level, she gains
the extreme range infusion. This ability
replaces the 3rd- and 9th-level infusions.
Ever-Present Threat (Su): At 4th level,
an elemental annihilator threatens all foes
within her natural reach. If anyone provokes
an attack of opportunity from her, she can form her melee devastating infusion and make the attack,
after which the weapon disappears. This ability replaces the
4th-level utility wild talent.

# 90
Blast Training (Ex): At 5th level, an elemental annihilator
gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with her
devastating infusion form infusion. This bonus increases
by 1 at 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter. This ability
replaces the 5th-level infusion.
Flurry of Devastation (Su): At 6th level, an elemental
annihilator can make a full attack of devastating infusions
against targets within 120 feet as a full-attack action. Each
individual attack deals damage as a devastating infusion.
This is a 3rd-level form infusion that costs 1 point of burn
and can be used with the same blast types as devastating
infusion. Abilities such as Rapid Shot and haste that grant
additional attacks apply normally to this full attack. If she
makes only melee attacks with her f lurry of devastation,
she can use the Two-Weapon Fighting feats (unlike with the
kinetic blade wild talent), but ranged devastating infusions
do not work with Two-Weapon Fighting. For the elemental
annihilator’s off-hand attacks with Two-Weapon Fighting,
she adds half her Constitution modifier to the damage
(increasing to her full Constitution modifier if she has
Double Slice). Though she can normally mix melee and
ranged attacks with her f lurry of devastation, she can’t do
so when she uses Two-Weapon Fighting. She can never
use metakinesis or substance infusions with f lurry of
devastation. This ability replaces the 6th-, 12th-, and 16thlevel
utility wild talents.
Omnicide (Su): At 20th level, an elemental annihilator
can unleash omnicide, a unique physical composite blast.
Omnicide deals 10d6+10 points of bludgeoning damage,
10d6+10 points of cold damage, 10d6+10 points of electricity
damage, 10d6+10 points of fire damage, and 10d6+10 points
of force damage, and counts as a blast of all five elements.
Omnicide costs 4 points of burn, which can be reduced by
composite specialization as normal. This ability replaces
omnikinesis and the 20th-level utility wild talent.

ELEMENTAL ASCETIC (ARCHETYPE)
Combining the elemental powers of a kineticist with
the rigid physical discipline of a monk, an elemental
ascetic channels his powers through his body to enhance
himself in combat.
Elemental Flurry (Su): At 1st level, an elemental ascetic
gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. He gains
the kinetic fist form infusion and it costs 0 points of burn
instead of 1 point of burn. When using the kinetic fist form
infusion with a full attack, he can make a f lurry of blows as
the monk class feature. He must use only his fists to make
this f lurry, no matter what other abilities he possesses.
Like a monk, he can use this ability only when unarmored,
not using a shield, and unencumbered. He can’t use his
kinetic blast without a form infusion, nor can he ever use
his kinetic blast with the chain, extended range, extreme
range, foe throw, f lurry of blasts, many throw, or snake form
infusions, or with any other form infusion that requires a
ranged attack roll or ranged touch attack roll. This ability
alters kinetic blast and replaces elemental overf low.
Elemental Wisdom (Su): An elemental ascetic can use his
Wisdom modifier instead of his Constitution modifier to
determine the DCs of Constitution-based wild talents, the
duration of wild talents with a Constitution-based duration,
and his bonus on concentration checks for wild talents.
This ability alters the key ability scores of wild talents.
AC Bonus (Ex): At 2nd level, when unarmored, not
using a shield, and unencumbered, an elemental ascetic
adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC and his CMD.
These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or
when the elemental ascetic is f lat-footed. He loses these
bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless. This bonus
increases by 1 for every 4 kineticist levels the elemental
ascetic possesses beyond 2nd. The elemental ascetic’s
kineticist levels stack with monk levels for the purpose
of determining when the bonus increases. An elemental
ascetic can never take the expanded defense utility wild
talent. This ability replaces elemental defense.
Powerful Fist (Su): At 5th level, an elemental ascetic can
accept 2 additional points of burn when using kinetic fist
to increase that infusion’s damage dice from d6s to d8s.
At 9th level, he can instead accept 3 additional points of
burn to increase the damage dice from d6s to d10s. At 13th
level, he can instead accept 4 additional points of burn to
increase the damage dice from d6s to d12s. All of these
options count as burn from a form infusion and can thus
be reduced by infusion specialization. This ability replaces
the 5th-, 9th-, and 13th-level infusions.

KINETIC CHIRURGEON (ARCHETYPE)
While any hydrokineticist or telekineticist can learn the
rudiments of healing, some kineticists are virtuosos of
the curative arts.
Kinetic Chirurgery (Su): A kinetic chirurgeon must select
either aether or water as her primary element. She gains
kinetic healer as a bonus wild talent at 1st level. At 3rd level
and every 2 levels thereafter, the kinetic chirurgeon can
select any one paladin mercy that a paladin of that level
could select. Each time she uses kinetic healer, she can
apply one of these mercies to the target of the healing. A
kinetic chirurgeon can never use infusions. This ability
replaces infusions.
Metahealer (Su): Starting at 5th level, a kinetic chirurgeon
can apply any one of the following metahealer abilities to
her kinetic healer wild talent instead of using her mercies.
At 5th level, she can choose to roll one additional die when
using kinetic healer. This increases to two additional dice at 11th level, and to three additional dice at 17th level. At
9th level, she can choose to bring an ally who died within
1 round back from the dead; this functions similarly to
the breath of life spell. The ally regains the normal number
of hit points from kinetic healer. An ally revived in this
way takes 1 additional point of burn, beyond the normal 1
point of burn that either the kinetic chirurgeon or the ally
must accept as a cost of the kinetic healer wild talent. At
13th level, a kinetic chirurgeon can choose to use kinetic
healer on herself as a swift action. At 17th level, she can
choose to heal both herself and another target with the
same use of kinetic healer, although in that case, both she
and her target must each accept 1 point of burn, instead of
only one of them needing to do so as normal for kinetic
healer. Regardless of her level, the kinetic chirurgeon can
apply only one metahealer ability to a single use of kinetic
healer. For instance, she could not bring back a dead ally
and also roll extra dice for healing. This ability replaces
metakinesis and infusion specialization.
# 91
Healing Buffer (Su): At 6th level, a kinetic chirurgeon’s
internal buffer has double the usual maximum size,
and she can use it only when she would accept points of
burn for the kinetic healer wild talent. This ability alters
internal buffer.

OVERWHELMING SOUL
(ARCHETYPE)
Some kineticists have such a powerful
personality that they can seize
control of their element with their
minds alone, without endangering
their bodies.
Mind Over Matter (Ex): An
overwhelming soul uses her
Charisma modifier instead of her
Constitution modifier to determine
her damage with wild talents,
the DCs of Constitutionbased
wild talents, the
duration of wild talents
with a Constitution-based
duration, her bonus on
concentration checks for wild
talents, and the other Constitutionbased
effects of all her wild talents.
She adds Bluff and Diplomacy
to her list of kineticist class
skills. This ability alters the
kineticist’s class skills and
the key ability score of
wild talents.
Mental Prowess (Su): An
overwhelming soul’s mind
is strong enough to protect her body from the stress of
channeling the elements. However, in exchange, she is
unable to push her limits quite as far as other kineticists.
She can’t choose to accept burn, though she can use wild
talents with a burn cost if she can reduce that cost to
0 points with abilities such as gather power and infusion
specialization. If she would be forced to accept burn
against her will (for example, if she fails a concentration
check), instead of taking burn she takes 1 temporary
negative level, which never kills her and can’t be removed
with restoration or greater restoration, but which disappears
automatically after 24 hours. At 6th level, once per day,
she can reduce the total burn cost of any wild talent by 1.
She can use this ability an additional time per day at
10th level and every 4 levels thereafter. This ability alters
burn and replaces internal buffer.
Overwhelming Power (Ex): At 3rd level, an overwhelming
soul gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls
with her kinetic blasts. The damage bonus doesn’t apply
to kinetic blade, kinetic whip, or other infusions that
don’t apply the damage bonus from elemental overf low.
This bonus increases by 1 at 6th level and every 3 levels
thereafter. This ability replaces elemental overf low.

BATTLE HOST (ARCHETYPE)
Well versed in military history, battlefield lore, and the
occult, a battle host forms a supernatural bond with a
chosen weapon, suit of armor, or shield, from which
he can channel psychic energy to cast spells, conjure
the spirit of the object’s former owner, increase his
own physical might, and produce a number of other
remarkable abilities.
Class Skills: A battle host adds Knowledge (local) (Int)
and Knowledge (nobility) (Int) as class skills. This alters
the occultist’s class skills.
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A battle host is
proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with
all types of armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields
(including tower shields). This replaces the occultist’s
weapon and armor proficiency.
Panoply Bond (Su): At 1st level, a battle host forms
a supernatural bond with a specif ic weapon, suit of
armor, or shield. This selection is permanent and can
never be changed. The bonded item is masterwork
quality and the battle host begins play with it at no cost.
The bonded item is immune to the broken condition
for as long as the battle host lives. If a battle host dies
and is restored to life, the bonded item is also restored
if it was destroyed. Any magic powers associated with
a battle host’s bonded item function only for the battle
host; in the hands of anyone else it is only a masterwork
item. The bonded item starts as an implement for any
single school of magic at 1st level, and gains access
to additional schools of magic at 2nd, 10th, 14th, and
18th levels, granting the battle host access to base focus
powers and resonant powers accordingly. The battle
host’s bonded item serves as his implement component
to cast occultist spells of all the schools that he knows.
However, he must split his mental focus among the
schools he knows for the purpose of determining
resonant powers and using focus powers, even though he
possesses only one physical item as an implement. This
ability alters implements, mental focus, spellcasting, and
implement mastery.
Battle Skill: At 2nd level, a battle host’s magic item
skill ability applies only on checks with weapons, armor,
and shields. This ability alters magic item skill.
Battle Reading: At 2nd level, a battle host can use object
reading on only weapons, armor, and shields. This ability
alters object reading.
Bonus Feats: At 4th, 8th, 12th, and 16th levels, a battle
host gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from
normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected
from those listed as combat feats. The battle host must
meet the prerequisites of these bonus feats. This ability
replaces shift focus, magic circles, binding circles, and
fast circles.
Spirit Warrior (Sp): At 5th level, a battle host can call
forth the spirit of a dead warrior who once owned his
bonded item. Calling the spirit is a standard action,
and unlike the use of most spell-like abilities, it doesn’t
provoke an attack of opportunity. This ability functions
as spiritual ally (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player’s Guide
246), using the battle host’s occultist level as his caster
level and his Intelligence modifier instead of his Wisdom
modifier to determine the spell’s effects. The battle host
can summon a spirit warrior once per day at 5th level,
plus one additional time per day for every 4 occultist
levels he possesses beyond 5th. This ability replaces
aura sight.
Heroic Splendor (Su): At 6th level, a battle host can
draw power from his bonded item to imbue himself with
superhuman strength, agility, or resilience. As a swift
action, a battle host can grant himself a +4 insight bonus
to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution for 1 minute. The
battle host can use this ability once per day at 6th level,
plus one additional time per day for every 4 occultist
levels he possesses beyond 6th. If he activates heroic
splendor again before the duration expires, the new
use of heroic splendor replaces the old use. This ability
replaces outside contact.
NECROCCULTIST (ARCHETYPE)
Necroccultists’ fascination with death and the undead
drives them to explore the forbidden necromantic arts
as they search for secrets they can use to manipulate the
natural cycle of life and death. They contact and learn
from the dead, rather than from items or outsiders,
allowing them to drain the life of their foes to feed their
own power, and even call forth phantasmal hordes of
spirits to destroy their enemies.
Necromantic Bond (Su): At 1st level, a necroccultist
gains access to only the necromancy school of implements.
He must select necromancy for his implement mastery.
Each time he gains an occultist level, a necroccultist can
add one necromancy spell from the wizard spell list to
his occultist spell list and his list of spells known. The
necroccultist can’t choose a spell of a higher level than
he is able to cast, and he adds the spell at the same spell
level it appears on the wizard spell list. At 14th level,
he doesn’t gain an additional school of implements.
Instead, at 14th level, the DCs of saving throws to resist a
necroccultist’s necromancy spells and necromancy focus powers increase by 2. This ability alters implements and
implement mastery.
# 101
Deadspeaker (Su): At 2nd level, as a full-round action
that provokes attacks of opportunity, a necroccultist
can learn the answers to a specific set of questions
concerning a dead or undead creature. The necroccultist
must consume at least one drop of the creature’s blood, a
small portion of its f lesh, or a fragment of one of its bones
as a part of this action. This ability otherwise functions
as blood biography (Advanced Player’s Guide 206), using
the necroccultist’s occultist level as his caster level.
The necroccultist can use this ability once per
day at 2nd level, plus one additional time per
day for every 2 occultist levels thereafter.
This ability replaces object reading.
Ghostly Horde (Su): At 5th level, a
necroccultist can spend 1 point of
mental focus from a necromancy
implement to summon a mob of
ghostly spirits to harass his enemies.
Summoning the ghostly horde is a
standard action that doesn’t provoke
attacks of opportunity. The ghostly
horde appears within 60 feet
of the necroccultist, fills an
area 20 feet in diameter, and
always hovers a few inches
off the ground (thus ignoring
any difficult terrain). The
necroccultist can command
the ghostly horde to move up
to 30 feet each round as a move
action, though the farthest edge of
the ghostly horde can never be more
than 60 feet from the necroccultist.
Any creature caught inside the ghostly
horde takes 1d6 points of damage per 2
occultist levels at the start of its turn (up
to a maximum of 10d6 points of damage
at 20th level). A successful Fortitude save
(DC = 10 + 1/2 the necroccultist’s occultist level
+ the necroccultist’s Intelligence modifier)
halves this damage. This damage is not
negative energy—it manifests in the
form of physical wounds and aches as if
from supernatural aging. Nonliving creatures
and creatures immune to magical aging are immune
to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all
forms of damage reduction. The ghostly horde remains
for 1 round, though at the beginning of his turn, the
necroccultist can expend 1 point of mental focus as a swift
action to extend the duration for 1 additional round. The
necroccultist can use this ability once per day at 5th level,
plus one additional time per day for every 5 occultist
levels thereafter. This ability replaces aura sight.
Life Drain (Sp): At 8th level, a necroccultist can expend
1 point of mental focus from a necromancy implement to
unleash a life-draining ray as a ranged touch attack that
causes the target to accrue 1d4 negative levels. The ray
has a range of 60 feet. The negative levels last a number
of minutes equal to the necroccultist’s occultist level.
For each negative level this attack gives a target, the
necroccultist regains a number of hit points equal
to his occultist level. The necroccultist can use
this ability once per day at 8th level, plus one
additional time per day for every 3 occultist
levels thereafter. This ability replaces
outside contact.
# 102
SHA’IR (ARCHETYPE)
Sha’irs delve into the occult not through power over
objects but instead via their connection with minor
servitor genies from the elemental planes. A sha’ir’s jin is
both a precious ally and a living implement for its master.
Jin (Su): At 1st level, a sha’ir learns how to contact a
jin—a minor, insubstantial genie that makes its home on
the elemental planes. She learns how to contact a second
jin at 6th level and a third jin at 14th level. Each of these
jin is connected to one of the eight schools of magic, just
like an occultist implement, but also to the air, earth,
fire, or water school (Advanced Player’s Guide 142). Each
jin works like a living implement for both of its schools.
To provide the implement component for a spell or focus
power, a jin must be within 30 feet of its master.
The elemental schools don’t have focus powers or
resonant powers. Instead, the sha’ir considers all wizard
spells of 6th level and lower from the lists corresponding
to her jin’s elemental schools to be on her occultist spell
list. In addition, she adds additional spells to her list of
spells known. For every spell level she can cast, she adds
one spell from each jin’s elemental school and one spell
from each jin’s non-elemental school.
A jin in its natural form has the base statistics of
a Small elemental of the chosen type with the young
simple template and without the air mastery, burn,
drench, earth glide, earth mastery, vortex, water mastery,
or whirlwind abilities.
At 20th level, a sha’ir selects one of her jin and chooses
one of its two schools instead of selecting an implement
for implement mastery.
If one of her jin is slain, the sha’ir is treated as if she
didn’t have the appropriate implement to cast the spells
associated with that jin. The sha’ir can replace the slain
jin the following morning by expending 1 point of mental
focus in a special ritual that takes 1 hour to perform.
This ability replaces implements and alters mental
focus, spellcasting, and implement mastery.
Augment Jin (Sp, Su): Starting at 2nd level, a sha’ir’s
jin uses its master’s base saving throws if they are better
than its own, and it uses either its own hit point total
or 1/2 its master’s hit points, whichever is higher. At
4th level, a sha’ir can concentrate for 1 full round and
expend 1 point of mental focus stored in a jin to grant
that jin all the statistics of a Small elemental of its type
for 1 round per occultist level (this includes gaining any
of the following abilities, if applicable: air mastery, burn,
drench, earth glide, earth mastery, vortex, water mastery,
and whirlwind). At 8th level, she can instead expend
2 points of mental focus to give one of her jin all the
statistics of a Medium elemental. At 10th level, the cost of
giving a jin the statistics of a Medium elemental decreases
to 1 point of mental focus, and the sha’ir can give a jin all
the statistics of a Large elemental for 2 points of mental
focus. At 12th level, the cost of giving a jin the statistics of
a Large elemental decreases to 1 point of mental focus and
the sha’ir can give a jin the statistics of a Huge elemental
for 2 points of mental focus. At 14th level, the cost of
giving a jin the statistics of a Huge elemental decreases
to 1 point of mental focus and the sha’ir can give a jin the
statistics of a greater elemental for 2 points of mental
focus. At 16th level, the sha’ir can give a jin the statistics
of an elder elemental for 3 points of mental focus. This
ability replaces magic item skill and object reading.
Manifest Jin (Su): At 7th level, the sha’ir can designate
one of her jin and manifest its powers, allowing it to
count as a Small elemental at all times, as if using
augment jin to augment it to a Small elemental but with
a permanent duration. By concentrating for 1 full round,
she can change which of her jin she manifests in this way.
This ability replaces aura sight.
Jin Spy (Su): At 8th level, when a sha’ir gains her outside
contact ability, instead of learning the true names of
outsiders, she can ask one or more of her jin to perform
tasks. She chooses from the same tasks listed under outside
contact (as appropriate to her occultist level). This doesn’t
require negotiation or gifts, but the jin is not available
to the sha’ir during the time it spends performing these
tasks. This ability alters outside contact.
TOME EATER (ARCHETYPE)
Tome eaters have learned how to tap into the latent
psychic energy of the written word by physically
devouring books and scrolls to create magical effects
and gain mystical insights. They use their bonded tomes
to gain access to all sorts of magic, and as they grow
in power, they gain an innate sense of the books and
writings around them.
Bonded Tome (Su): At 1st level, a tome eater forms a
supernatural bond with a specific book. She can replace
her bonded tome with another book at any time, though
the tome eater must perform a 24-hour binding ritual to
attune herself to the new book.
The bonded tome starts as an implement for any
two schools of magic at 1st level, and it gains access to
additional schools of magic at 2nd, 10th, 14th, and 18th
levels, granting the tome eater access to base focus
powers and resonant powers accordingly. The tome
eater’s bonded tome serves as her implement component
to cast occultist spells of all schools she knows. However,
she must split her mental focus among the schools she
knows for the purpose of determining resonant powers
and using focus powers, even though she possesses only
one physical item as an implement. Once per day as part
of casting an occultist spell, a tome eater can expend 1
point of mental focus tied to the appropriate school to
increase the spell’s caster level by 1 or increase the spell’s
DC by 1. A tome eater can enhance a spell in this manner
one additional time per day at 6th level, and another
time per day for every 5 occultist levels she possesses
beyond 6th. This ability alters implements, mental focus,
spellcasting, and implement mastery.
# 103
Devour Books and Scrolls (Sp): A tome eater can
devour books and scrolls in order to gain various
benefits. Devouring a book or scroll is a full-round
action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A devoured
book or scroll is absorbed into the tome eater’s body and
completely destroyed.
At 4th level, once per day a tome eater can devour a
spell scroll or a book to regain mental focus, which she
can divide as she likes among her schools of magic, to a
maximum of the amount of mental focus she assigned to
that school at the beginning of the day. If she devours a
scroll, a tome eater regains a number of points of mental
focus equal to the spell level of the highest-level spell
contained on the scroll. If she devours a nonmagical
book that contains at least 100 pages of written text
and is worth at least 25 gp, a tome eater regains 1 point
of mental focus. If she devours a magical book, she
regains a number of points of mental focus equal
to half the caster level of the item. If the tome
eater devours a spellbook with at least 50 pages of
spells of 1st level or higher, she regains 4 points of
mental focus.
At 6th level, a tome eater can ready an action to
devour an enemy’s spell when an enemy within 30
feet attempts to cast a spell from a scroll. This ability
works as the counterspell action as if the tome eater were
using dispel magic, though the tome eater doesn’t need to
cast a spell to counter the enemy’s spell. A tome eater can
use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one
additional time per day for every 4 occultist levels
beyond 6th. If a tome eater readies an action
to use this ability and the readied action
never triggers, she doesn’t expend a daily
use of this ability. At 16th level, the tome
eater can use this ability as an immediate
action without readying an action.
At 8th level, a tome eater can devour a book or scroll
as a standard action. Additionally, whenever a tome eater
successfully uses this ability to counter a spell being cast
from a scroll, she can devour the enemy’s scroll without
spending any additional actions if she hasn’t devoured a
scroll or book yet that day.
At 12th level, a tome eater can devour a book or scroll
as a move action. Additionally, whenever a tome eater
successfully uses this ability to counter a spell being
cast from a scroll, she can choose to turn the spell
back on its caster (as spell turning) instead of devouring
the scroll. She can do this whether or not she has devoured
a scroll or book yet that day.
This ability replaces shift focus, the implement gained
at 6th level, magic circles, outside contact, binding circles,
and fast circles.
Word Sense (Sp, Su): At 5th level, a tome eater is
constantly under the effect of read magic. Additionally,
she can automatically detect the general topic of a piece
of writing, and whether that writing is a magical scroll
or tome, simply by looking at it. If she spends 1 round
concentrating on a text within 30 feet per 100 pages of the
text, she can gain a sense of a text’s contents as if she had
skimmed the text. This ability replaces aura sight.




# Psychic
# 104
AMNESIAC (ARCHETYPE)
The amnesiac once possessed great psychic power, but
mental blocks—resulting from either a traumatic event
or intentional implantation—have caused her to forget
what she knew before. The amnesiac’s struggle to control
her psychic magic leads to wild and unpredictable results.
Repressed Memories: All the amnesiac’s older memories
have been deeply hidden, as though she had been affected
by multiple repress memory* spells. She isn’t prevented from
remembering things that happen over the course of a game,
but might be forgetful. If the amnesiac’s
memories are ever restored, she loses this
archetype and reverts to a standard psychic.
Spells: An amnesiac’s ability to cast
psychic spells is the same as that of
the psychic class, with the following
exceptions.
An amnesiac’s faulty memory makes
remembering and casting spells difficult,
but the increased f lexibility can be a great
benefit. Instead of choosing a number of
spells known from Table 1–8: Psychic Spells
Known, an amnesiac accesses spells she
knew the previous day from the recesses
of her mind. This requires 1 hour of
meditation. Each day, for each spell level
the amnesiac can cast, she retains a number
of spells known equal to half the number
listed on Table 1–8, rounded up. These spells
must be selected from spells the amnesiac
knew the previous day (including any spells
she remembered using spell recollection;
see below). The remainder of her
spells known (half the number on
Table 1–8, rounded down) become
amnesia slots, which the amnesiac can
use with her spell recollection ability
(see below). To determine the
spells she knows on the day
when she first takes this
archetype, the amnesiac
picks any one 1st-level
spell from the psychic
spell list.
This change to spells doesn’t apply to knacks (0-level
spells) or discipline spells, which function the same way they
do for a normal psychic. When the amnesiac gains access to
3rd-level spells, she gains full recall of her 1st-level spells
and no longer gains 1st-level amnesia slots, instead gaining
the full number of 1st-level spells known from Table 1–8
and casting them as a normal psychic. When this happens,
the amnesiac can select any level-appropriate spells from
the psychic spell list as her spells known, even if they were
never among the spells she prepared or recalled; once
selected, these spells can no longer be changed, as with a
normal psychic. Each time the psychic gains access to a new
level of spells, she gains full memory of spells 2 levels lower
in the same way (gaining full memory and permanently
selecting her 2nd-level spells when she gains access to 4thlevel
spells, and so on). This ability alters spellcasting.
Spell Recollection (Ex): Once per hour as a swift action, an
amnesiac can attempt to remember any spell from the psychic
spell list of her choice from either of the 2 highest spell levels
she can cast. When she does, she rolls on Table 2–1: Spell
Recollection to determine the result. Because the mental
stress of combat brings memories to the surface more easily,
the amnesiac adds 1d10 to this roll’s result if she’s in combat
when she attempts to recall a spell. Regardless of
the result, the amnesiac expends an amnesia
slot of the appropriate level for the spell she
is attempting to remember; she must cast
the spell remembered (if any) using that
amnesia slot during the same round,
or the spell slot is lost without effect.
Once a spell has been remembered
in this way, the amnesiac can cast
it as one of her spells known for
the rest of the day (even if she failed
to cast the spell during the round in
which she remembered it), unless spell
recollection allowed her to cast a spell of
a higher level than she would normally be able
to cast.
FORMLESS
ADEPT
(ARCHETYPE)
Formless adepts master
their psychic powers to
unshackle themselves
from the conf ines of the
f lesh and empower their
spellcasting. They learn
to assume increasingly
insubstantial forms
until they become like
living ghosts.

# 105
Phrenic Charisma: A formless adept uses his Charisma
modifier to determine the number of points in his phrenic
pool. This ability alters phrenic pool.
Formless Body: A formless adept gradually sheds his
body, taking on increasingly nebulous forms. A formless
adept can assume a formless body as a standard action.
He can remain in each formless body type for a number
of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. The
rounds don’t have to be used consecutively, but must be
used in 1-round increments. Resuming his physical form
takes another standard action; otherwise, the formless
adept continues spending rounds of formless body until he
runs out of them. The formless adept must return to his
physical form before assuming a different formless body.
Blurred Body (Su): At 1st level, a formless adept can act
under the effect of a blur spell. At 5th level, the formless adept
can use this ability for a number of minutes per day instead
of rounds per day. These minutes don’t have to be used
consecutively, but must be used in 1-minute increments.
Gaseous Body (Su): At 5th level, a formless adept can become
gaseous as gaseous form. At 13th level, the formless adept can
use this ability for a number of minutes per day instead
of rounds per day. These minutes don’t have to be used
consecutively, but must be used in 1-minute increments.
Incorporeal Body (Su): At 13th level, a formless adept can
become incorporeal (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 301).
This ability replaces the psychic discipline and discipline
powers class features.
Formless Spell: At 1st level, a formless adept gains the
formless spell phrenic amplification. He can spend 1 point
from his phrenic pool to cast a spell with a standard-action
casting time as part of the action he uses to assume his
formless body, expending the spell slot as normal. This
ability replaces the 1st-level phrenic amplification.
Bonus Spells: The formless adept adds extra spells to his
list of spells known while he’s in a formless body (including
when he uses the formless spell phrenic amplification).
Spells with a duration last for their full duration, even if
the psychic reverts to his physical form. For feats and other
abilities that require these spells as prerequisites, the
psychic counts as knowing the spells but can benefit from
the feats and abilities only while in a formless body. The
formless adept gains the following spells at the appropriate
levels: chill touch and expeditious retreat (1st), levitate and
stricken heartACG (4th), gaseous form and vampiric touch (6th),
shadow stepUM and telekinesis (8th), dominate person and synapse
overload* (10th), disintegrate and enemy hammerAPG (12th), finger
of death and telekinetic sphere (14th), etherealness and power word
stun (16th), and dominate monster and telekinetic storm* (18th).
This ability replaces discipline spells.
Psychic Possession (Su): At 15th level, while using his
incorporeal body ability, a formless adept can attempt to
psychically possess another living creature. To use this
ability, the formless adept must be adjacent to the target.
This effect works as the greater possession* spell and can be
maintained only as long as the formless adept maintains
his incorporeal body form. The target can attempt a Will
save with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the formless adept’s class
level + the formless adept’s Intelligence modifier to resist
the effect. A creature that successfully saves is immune to
the formless adept’s psychic possession for 24 hours. This
ability replaces the 15th-level phrenic amplification.
Formless Master (Su): At 20th level, a formless adept can
assume any formless body as a swift action and change
between formless body types as a standard action (without
returning to his physical form first). He can use the formless
spell phrenic amplification to cast any spell with a swiftaction
casting time when assuming a formless body or any
spell with a standard-action casting time while switching
between formless bodies. The formless adept also adds
his Charisma bonus as a def lection bonus to his AC while
in a formless body. A formless adept can attempt a saving
throw to bypass any spells that prevent entry of incorporeal
creatures (such as anti-incorporeal shellACG), even if the spells
don’t normally allow one. This ability replaces remade self.
MUTATION MIND (ARCHETYPE)
Exposure to unintended spell effects, curses, or sources of
radiation cause some to manifest psychic powers. When
a mutation mind uses her psychic abilities, her physical
body changes under the stress, and she risks losing control
if she pushes too far.
Physical Mutation (Su): A mutation mind’s psychic
powers warp her body, allowing her to physically
mutate herself as a swift action, which grants her a
+4 enhancement bonus to Strength and a –2 penalty to
Intelligence. At 12th level, the bonus to Strength increases
to +6. A mutation mind can assume her physically mutated
form for a number of minutes per day equal to her psychic
level. The minutes don’t have to be used consecutively, but
must be used in 1-minute increments. When the duration runs out, the mutation mind can spend 1 point from
her phrenic pool to extend the duration by 1 round. She
can continue extending it in this way until she runs out
of points. After the mutation ends, the mutation mind
is fatigued and can’t activate a physical mutation again
for 1 round. Turning back to normal before the end of a
1-minute increment takes a standard action. This ability
replaces the 1st-level phrenic amplification.

# 106
Bodily Mutations: Starting at 3rd level, whenever a
mutation mind gains a phrenic amplification, she can
select either a phrenic amplification or a bodily mutation. A
bodily mutation grants its benefit only when the mutation
mind is affected by her physical mutation. Each time she
activates her physical mutation, she can activate any number
of bodily mutations she possesses.
Adhesive (Ex): The mutation mind’s skin becomes
sticky, granting her a +4 bonus on disarm and grapple
combat maneuver checks.
Bite Attack (Ex): The mutation mind’s mouth fills
with sharp teeth, allowing her to make a bite attack as
part of a full-attack action at her highest base attack
bonus. This attack deals 1d4 points of damage
(1d3 if Small) and counts as a primary attack unless
combined with manufactured weapon attacks,
as normal.
Bulging Eyes (Ex): The mutation
mind’s eyes grow large and round,
granting her darkvision with a range
of 60 feet.
Claws (Ex): The mutation
mind’s hands turn into claws,
allowing her to make two claw
attacks as a full-attack action
at her highest base attack
bonus. Each of these attacks
deals 1d4 points of damage
(1d3 if Small) and counts as a
primary attack unless combined
with manufactured weapon attacks,
as normal.
Elongated Fingers (Ex): The mutation
mind’s fingers grow long and supple,
increasing her reach by 5 feet when she’s
making melee touch attacks.
Elongated Legs (Ex): The mutation mind’s
legs become long and spindly, increasing her
base movement by 10 feet.
Energy Resistance (Ex): The mutation mind’s
body changes in color and texture, and gains
energy resistance 5 to one energy type (acid,
cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), chosen when
this mutation is selected. This mutation can
be selected multiple times. Each time it is
selected, the mutation mind either chooses an additional
energy type to gain energy resistance 5 against or increases
the resistance granted to one existing type by 5.
Enlarged Torso (Ex): The mutation mind’s torso enlarges
disproportionately with the rest of her body, granting her
a +2 natural armor bonus to AC.
Rubbery (Ex): The mutation mind’s body becomes soft
and rubbery, granting her DR 2/—.
Slimy (Ex): The mutation mind exudes a thin layer of
oily slime over her body, granting her a +4 bonus to CMD.
This ability alters phrenic amplifications.
Phrenic Empowerment (Su): At 7th level, a mutation
mind’s phrenic amplifications empower her physical
mutation. Whenever a mutation mind modifies a spell
with a phrenic amplification while affected by her physical
mutation, she can increase the bonus to her Strength score
from her physical mutation by 2 for a number of rounds
equal to the level of the spell she cast. This bonus doesn’t
stack; if the mutation mind activates it again, she uses
the longer duration but doesn’t increase the bonus.
While under the effect of phrenic empowerment,
whenever the mutation mind takes damage, she
risks losing control of her powers. At the end of
each turn that she takes hit point damage, the
mutation mind must succeed at a Will save (DC =
15 + 1/2 her character level) or take a –2 penalty on
Will saving throws and to Intelligence. These
penalties last for 1 hour after the
physical mutation ends and
stack with themselves.
If the penalty lowers
her Intelligence score to 0,
the mutation mind is comatose until
1 hour after physical mutation ends.
Improved Bodily Mutations: At 11th level,
a mutation mind can select one of the
following improved bodily mutations
instead of a phrenic amplification.
Aquatic Form (Ex): The mutation
mind’s legs fuse into a tail and fins
to sprout from her back and side,
granting her a swim speed of
30 feet, tremorsense with a range
of 30 feet (affecting other creatures
in contact with the same body of
water), and the aquatic subtype.
Her base land speed is reduced
to 10 feet.
Enlarged Body (Ex): The
mutation mind’s body swells
and stretches, enlarging her as
the enlarge person spell but up to two size
categories larger (maximum Huge).
# 107
Multiple Eyes (Ex): Multiple eyes erupt all over the
mutation mind’s body. She can’t be f lanked and gains a
+4 bonus on Perception checks.
Recuperation (Ex): The mutation mind heals quickly
from physical wounds, gaining fast healing 5.
Toppling Fists (Ex): The mutation mind’s fists become
large masses of f lesh, allowing her to attempt a bull rush
combat maneuver check against one creature within
10 feet of her as a standard action.
Wings (Ex): The mutation mind sprouts a pair of f leshy,
batlike wings, giving her a f ly speed of 60 feet with
average maneuverability.
This ability alters major amplifications.
PSYCHIC DUELIST (ARCHETYPE)
Psychic duelists hone their mental powers for combat,
much as warriors do with their blades. They specialize
in psychic duels, perfecting their thought-form creatures
into mighty weapons.
Psychic Duel Acumen (Ex): At 4th level, a psychic
duelist adds instigate psychic duel* to her list of spells
known, and the save DC of any instigate psychic duel spell
she casts increases by 1. Beginning at 6th level, she can
also expend any unused psychic spell slot of 3rd level or
higher to cast instigate psychic duel. If she does so, she uses
the level of the spell slot expended to determine the Will
save DC. In addition, when the psychic duelist sacrifices
points from her phrenic pool to generate manifestation
points for an offensive manifestation, she uses d8s for
damage dice instead of d4s. This ability replaces the
4th-level discipline spell.
Manifestation Amplifications: At 7th level, a psychic
duelist gains a manifestation amplification instead of a
phrenic amplification; thereafter, whenever the psychic
duelist gains a phrenic amplification, she can select either
a phrenic amplification or a manifestation amplification. A
manifestation amplification functions for a manifestation
as a phrenic amplification does for a spell, with the same
restrictions. The manifestation being amplified is called
the linked manifestation. Phrenic pool points spent
toward manifestation amplifications are separate from
points sacrificed to generate manifestation points. For
example, a psychic duelist capable of casting 4th-level
spells (with a maximum of 4 MP per manifestation) could
turn 4 points from her phrenic pool into MP and spend 2
points on a manifestation amplification, expending a total
of 6 points from her phrenic pool.
Extended Effect (Ex): The psychic duelist can spend points
from her phrenic pool to increase the duration of a condition
by 1 round per point spent. She can spend a maximum of 1
phrenic pool point in this way; this maximum increases to
2 points at 11th level, to 3 points at 15th level, and to 4 points
at 19th level. If the target succeeds at its saving throw, this
amplification has no effect (though the points are still
lost). This amplification can be linked only to offensive
manifestations that impose conditions.
Faithful Creature (Ex): When she manifests a thoughtform
creature, the psychic duelist can spend 1 point from
her phrenic pool to give that creature the ability to persist
even if it doesn’t attack. She can concentrate to maintain
the creature as a swift action instead of as a full-round
action, but the creature can attack only if the psychic
duelist concentrates as a full-round action. In addition, the
psychic backlash damage from that thought-form creature
is halved. This amplification can be linked only to thoughtform
creature manifestations.
Punishing Thought-form (Ex): The psychic duelist can
spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to increase the damage
die size of an offensive manifestation by one step (d4 to d6,
d6 to d8, or d8 to d10). This amplification can be linked only
to offensive manifestations.
Reciprocal Defense (Su): The psychic duelist can spend
1 point from her phrenic pool when using a defensive
manifestation to improve her defenses in the real world
as well. Her physical body gains a +2 insight bonus to AC
for the number of rounds the defensive manifestation
lasts, or for 1 round if the manifestation doesn’t have a
duration. This bonus increases to +3 at 11th level and to
+4 at 15th level. This amplification can be linked only to
defensive manifestations.
This ability replaces the 7th-level phrenic amplification
and alters phrenic amplifications.
Thought Made Real (Su): At 9th level, a psychic duelist
can bring offensive manifestations directly into her foes’
minds, attacking with them without entering a psychic duel.
When doing so, she can generate manifestation points only
by sacrificing a spell, not through any other methods. Using
an offensive manifestation in this way functions as casting
a spell with a full-round-action casting time. Conditions
imposed by these offensive manifestations last for their
full duration, even though the target isn’t in a psychic duel.
The psychic duelist can use manifestation amplifications
on offensive manifestations created this way. Such offensive
manifestations can’t affect thought-form creatures. This
is a mind-affecting illusion (phantasm) effect. A thoughtform
creature manifested in this way is visible only to its
target. This ability replaces telepathic bond.
Expert Manifester (Ex): At 17th level, a psychic duelist
doesn’t have to expend as many resources to create
manifestations. She gains 1 additional MP each time she
creates a psychic manifestation, in addition to the MP
she gains by sacrificing resources. This doesn’t increase
the maximum number of points she can spend per
manifestation, but does allow her to create a manifestation
costing 1 MP without sacrificing any resources. This
ability replaces telepathy.
# 108


# Spiritualist
ECTOPLASMATIST (ARCHETYPE)
Instead of calling upon a phantom from the Ethereal
Plane, an ectoplasmatist infuses herself with the
mysterious substance called ectoplasm.
Ectoplasmic Lash (Su): At 1st level, as a full-round
action an ectoplasmatist can manifest one or two lashes
of ectoplasm tethered to her by wispy, ectoplasmic
tendrils. If she manifests two lashes, she can wield them
both as light melee weapons, each dealing 1d6 points of
slashing damage (1d4 if the ectoplasmatist is Small) with
a critical threat range and multiplier of 19–20/×2. If the
ectoplasmatist manifests only one lash, she can manifest
it either as a single one-handed melee weapon that deals
1d8 points of slashing damage (1d6 if the ectoplasmatist
is Small) with a critical threat range and multiplier of
19–20/×2, or as a two-handed melee weapon that deals 2d6
points of bludgeoning damage (1d10 if the ectoplasmatist
is Small) with a critical multiplier of ×2. Only the
ectoplasmatist can wield or use these lashes. Dismissing
any or all manifested lashes is a free action.
At 2nd level, the ectoplasmatist’s lashes gain a
+1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, and
are treated as magic weapons.
At 4th level, the ectoplasmatist can use her lashes as
reach weapons or use them to manipulate objects from
a distance. When used as weapons, the lashes gain an
additional 5 feet of reach. Unlike most other weapons
with reach, the lashes can be used to attack foes anywhere
within the ectoplasmatist’s reach (including adjacent foes).
Attacks with the lashes’ extended reach provoke attacks of
opportunity just as if the ectoplasmatist were attacking
with a ranged weapon. When the lashes are used to
manipulate items, they have the same manual dexterity as
the ectoplasmatist’s hands. Using the lashes to manipulate
items always provokes attacks of opportunity, even if the
action the ectoplasmatist is taking normally wouldn’t.
At 6th level, the lashes’ enhancement bonus increases
to +2, and they are treated as having the ectoplasmatist’s
alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
At 8th level, the ectoplasmatist’s lashes become ghost
touch weapons and their reach increases by another 5 feet
(for a total increase of 10 feet). Additionally, attacks with the
lashes against nonadjacent foes no longer provoke attacks of
opportunity. Using the lashes to manipulate objects from a distance still provokes attacks of opportunity, but only
if the action the ectoplasmatist is taking would normally
provoke such attacks (instead of always provoking).
At 10th level, the lashes’ enhancement bonus increases
to +3.
At 12th level, the ectoplasmatist chooses a single
emotional focus (anger, dedication, despair, fear, hatred,
jealousy, or zeal). The ectoplasmatist’s lashes gain a special
weapon ability as if affected by a spirit-bound blade spell (see
page 187) matching the emotional energy of the focus the
ectoplasmatist has chosen.
At 14th level, the lashes’ enhancement bonus increases
to +4.
At 16th level, the ectoplasmatist chooses a second
emotional focus, and her lashes gain the special weapon
abilities as if affected by a spirit-bound blade spell with
the special weapon ability of both of the ectoplasmatist’s
chosen emotional foci.
At 18th level, the lashes’ enhancement bonus increases
to +5.
This ability replaces etheric tether, phantom, shared
consciousness, fused consciousness, spiritual bond, and
empowered consciousness.
Spiritual Combat (Su): At 3rd level, as a full-round action,
an ectoplasmatist can make all of her attacks with a single
light or one-handed ectoplasmic lash wielded in one hand,
and also cast a single spiritualist spell with a casting time
of one standard action as a free action either before or after
making the ectoplasmic lash attacks. The ectoplasmatist
takes a –2 penalty on her attack rolls when using spiritual
combat. If she decides to cast the spell defensively, she
can choose to take an additional penalty on her attack
rolls up to her Wisdom bonus, and add the same amount
as a circumstance bonus on her concentration check. If
the concentration check fails, the spell is wasted, but the
attacks still take the penalty.
Also, when the ectoplasmatist casts a spiritualist spell
with a range of touch, she can deliver the spell through
one of her ectoplasmic lashes. Instead of making the free
melee touch attack she would normally use to deliver
the spell, the ectoplasmatist can choose to make a free
ectoplasmic lash attack at her highest base attack bonus. A
successful lash attack deals damage normally and imparts
the spell’s effects. The ectoplasmatist can’t hold the charge
if her lash attack misses.
This ability replaces bonded manifestation, phantom
recall, and dual bond.
Ectoplasmic Armor (Su): At 4th level when an
ectoplasmatist manifests her spiritual lash ability,
tendrils of ectoplasmic material envelop her body,
granting her a +4 armor bonus to AC.
At 12th level, the ectoplasmatist’s armor bonus to AC
increases to +6 and is treated as ghost touch armor. This ability replaces spiritual interference and greater
spiritual interference.

# 109
FRACTURED MIND (ARCHETYPE)
Most spiritualists harbor the spirits of the deceased in
their psyches, but a small number of them—known as
fractured minds—draw their powers instead from a
fraction of their own souls that resonates with extremely
powerful emotions. These spiritualists’ phantoms are
not spiritual allies, but rather extensions of the fractured
minds’ own inner thoughts and emotions.
Emotional Spellcasting: A fractured mind’s ability to
cast spells is tied to the force of her own spirit rather than
her connection to the spirit world. As a result, she uses
her Charisma score rather than her Wisdom score to
determine the highest spell level she can cast, the saving
throw DCs of spells she casts, and her bonus spells per day.
This ability alters spellcasting.
Emotional Power (Sp): The fractured mind gains
a number of spell-like abilities, which are tied to her
phantom’s emotional focus. She gains one spell-like
ability at 5th level, a second at 7th level, a third at 9th level,
and a fourth at 16th level. A fractured mind can use each
of these abilities once per day, plus one additional time per
day for every 4 spiritualist levels she possesses beyond the
level at which she gained the spell-like ability. The saving
throw DCs for these spell-like abilities are equal to 10 + 1/2
the fractured mind’s spiritualist class level + the fractured
mind’s Charisma modifier, rather than being based on
the spell’s level. The spell-like abilities granted by each
emotional focus are listed below.
Anger: Enlarge person (5th), rage (7th), longstrider (9th),
shout (16th).
Dedication: Command (5th), spiritual weapon (7th), bless
(9th), death ward (16th).
Despair: BungleUM (5th), stricken heartACG (7th), doom (9th),
crushing despair (16th).
Fear: Bane (5th), mad hallucinationUM (7th), doom (9th),
phantasmal killer (16th).
Hatred: Doom (5th), inf lict moderate wounds (7th), bane
(9th), bestow curse (16th).
Jealousy: Sanctuary (5th), resist energy (7th), entropic shield
(9th), spell immunity (16th).
Zeal: Bless (5th), spiritual weapon (7th), divine favor (9th),
freedom of movement (16th).
This ability replaces detect undead, calm spirit, see
invisibility, and call spirit.
GEIST CHANNELER (ARCHETYPE)
Some phantoms retain less of their personalities and
memories than others. Though most phantoms maintain
some semblance of their former selves, others of their kind,
known as geists, came close to being lost forever before they
became phantoms. Incapable of manifesting in ectoplasmic
form and devoid of human emotions, these strange entities
are much closer to ghosts than most other phantoms.
The spiritualists who work with them, known as geist
channelers, are able to call on them in unique ways.
Geistform Phantom (Su): A geist channeler’s phantom
can’t manifest in ectoplasmic form, and is limited to
manifesting in incorporeal form. As a result, the phantom
has no Strength score, and has a starting Wisdom score
of 12. Instead of gaining two slam attacks, it gains only a
single slam attack that deals 1d8 points of damage. The
slam attack’s damage increases to 1d10 points at 5th level,
to 2d6 at 10th level, to 2d8 at 15th level, and 2d10 at 20th
level (assuming the phantom is Medium). The phantom
does not gain the magic attacks ability at 4th level.
While manifested incorporeally, a geist channeler’s
phantom can attack only other incorporeal creatures.
Because the phantom is incorporeal, the damage it deals
to such creatures is not reduced as a result of them being
incorporeal. At 5th level, the phantom can take a swift
action to infuse itself with trace amounts of ectoplasm so
it can attack corporeal creatures for 1 round. During that
time, it deals half damage to corporeal creatures with its
slam, and corporeal creatures with nonmagical weapons
deal half damage to the phantom. At 10th level, when the
phantom infuses itself, its attacks deal normal damage to
corporeal creatures.
This ability alters the phantom.
# 110
Emotionless (Su): A geist channeler’s phantom doesn’t
have an emotional focus; instead, it is cold and devoid
of emotions. The phantom gains a number of ranks in
Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (religion) equal to
its Hit Dice. While confined in the geist channeler’s
consciousness, the phantom grants the geist channeler
Skill Focus in each of these skills. The phantom has good
Ref lex and Will saves, and gains Iron Will as a bonus feat,
as well as the following abilities.
Unnerving Touch (Su): As a standard action, a geist
channeler’s phantom can make a melee touch attack
against a living creature, even if that creature is corporeal.
If the attack hits, the target is shaken for 1d4+1 rounds. A
successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom’s Hit Dice
+ the phantom’s Charisma modifier) negates this effect.
At 5th level, when the phantom can damage corporeal
creatures with its slam attack, its slam attacks against
living corporeal creatures gain this ability. Multiple
attacks against the same creature don’t cause the creature
to become frightened. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
Poltergeist’s Knack (Sp): At 7th level, a geist channeler’s
phantom can use telekinesis as a spell-like ability. It can
use only the sustained force and violent thrust versions of
this spell. The phantom can use this ability three times
per day, plus one additional time at 10th level and every
3 levels thereafter (maximum seven times per day at 19th
level). Its caster level for this spell-like ability is equal to
the phantom’s Hit Dice.
Spectral Protection (Su): At 12th level as a standard action,
while a geist channeler’s phantom is confined within his
psyche, he can call upon its power to project an aura of
spectral energy that prevents incorporeal creatures from
approaching him. This takes the form of a 30-foot-radius
emanation centered on the geist channeler. Any incorporeal
creature attempting to enter this area must succeed at a
Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the geist channeler’s spiritualist
class level + the geist channeler’s Wisdom modifier) or be
unable to do so. This ability can be used only defensively,
not aggressively; forcing the aura against an incorporeal
creature collapses the aura. The geist channeler can use
this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to his
spiritualist level. The minutes don’t need to be continuous,
but must be spent in 1-minute increments.
Malevolent Possession (Sp): At 17th level, a geist channeler’s
phantom can invade the bodies of other creatures. This
functions as possession (see page 181). To use this ability,
the phantom must be adjacent to the target. The target
can resist the effect with a successful Will save (DC = 10
+ 1/2 the phantom’s Hit Dice + the phantom’s Charisma
modifier). The phantom can use this ability once per day.
This ability modifies the phantom and replaces the
phantom’s emotional focus.
Spiritual Manifestation (Su): Because of the nature
of her phantom, a geist channeler can use the bonded
manifestation ability to manifest his phantom only in
incorporeal form. This ability alters bonded manifestation.
HAUNTED (ARCHETYPE)
The haunted are a dangerous breed of spellcasters bound
to temperamental and unpredictable phantoms that
leech power from their spiritualists.
Usurp Manifestation (Su): At 3rd level, the haunted’s
phantom begins to subtly subvert the relationship with
its master, gaining rather than granting power from the
connection. When fully manifested in ectoplasmic form,
the phantom can use its usurp manifestation ability to
draw upon the haunted’s body to strengthen its ectoplasmic
might, temporarily weakening the spiritualist in order
to increase its own power. The phantom must activate
this ability as an immediate action at the start of the
spiritualist’s turn, and it can use this ability a number of
rounds per day equal to 3 + the haunted’s spiritualist level.
The rounds don’t need to be consecutive, and the phantom
can dismiss the effects of a usurped manifestation as
a free action on its turn. While this ability is in effect,
the haunted’s features become sunken and withdrawn,
and she gains the nauseated condition until the effect
ends. Conversely, the phantom surges in size and power,
becoming one size category larger (as if affected by an
enlarge person spell) and increasing its natural armor
bonus to AC by 2 for the effect’s duration. If the spiritualist
prevents or mitigates the nauseated condition, the
phantom is unable to siphon energy and doesn’t gain the
benefits of usurp manifestation.
At 8th level and every 5 levels thereafter (13th and 18th
levels), the phantom gains new abilities while using
usurp manifestation.
Usurp Spell: At 8th level, while using usurp manifestation,
the phantom can leech spell slots from the haunted to
increase its own power. The phantom can reach through
the etheric tether as a swift action to drain the nauseated
haunted’s psychic spell energy, effectively taking any touch
spell or spell with a target of “you” that the haunted knows
and casting it on itself (assuming the haunted has not yet
used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level).
This ability consumes two of the haunted’s spell slots of the
appropriate level and otherwise follows the rules for the
share spells and deliver touch spells abilities.
Teleplasmic Surge: At 13th level, when using usurp
manifestation, the phantom gains a +2 morale bonus on
attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.
Ferocious Phantom: At 18th level, when using usurp
manifestation the phantom gains DR 10/slashing and spell
resistance equal to 11 + the haunted’s spiritualist level (this
spell resistance doesn’t apply to spells originating from
the spiritualist or from the usurp spell ability).
This ability replaces bonded manifestation.
# 111
Usurped Bond (Su): At 17th level, the haunted’s phantom
can use usurp manifestation for a number of rounds per
day equal to 3 + double the haunted’s spiritualist level.
This ability replaces dual bond.
ONMYOJI (ARCHETYPE)
Though most spiritualists are chosen by their phantoms,
others deliberately call phantoms to them through years of
careful preparation and study in obscure divine traditions.
These spiritualists, known as onmyoji, form close bonds
with their phantoms, as any other spiritualist does, but see
the phantoms as partners and tools in their work. Onmyoji
serve as emissaries between the mundane world and the
spiritual one, either working to ensure that troubles in the
spiritual world do not spill over into the world of mortals,
or stirring up spiritual trouble in order to achieve their
ends among the living.
Divine Spellcasting: An onmyoji’s spellcasting ability
comes from divine rather than psychic power. As a divine
caster, the onmyoji’s spells use verbal components instead
of thought components, and somatic components instead
of emotional components, and she uses an ofuda as a
divine focus. Ofudas are scrolls with holy writings written
on parchment, cloth, or wood (having the same cost as a
wooden holy symbol) or metal (having the same cost as a
silver holy symbol). This ability alters spellcasting.
Spiritual Resistance (Su): An onmyoji’s phantom
provides her with protection from supernatural forces.
While the phantom is confined within the onmyoji’s
consciousness (not stranded on the Ethereal Plane or
fully manifested), it grants her a +2 bonus on saving
throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities
of fey, outsiders, and incorporeal undead. At 6th level and
every 6 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (to a
maximum of +5 at 18th level). This ability replaces shared
consciousness and fused consciousness.
Divine Teachings (Su): An onmyoji gains the ability to
call upon her phantom to help her cast spells she normally
couldn’t. At 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, an
onmyoji can choose a single spell from the cleric spell list
with a spell level she is currently able to cast, and add that
spell to her list of spells known, at the same spell level
as it appears on the cleric spell list. Because the onmyoji
relies on her phantom’s inf luence in order to cast these
spells, she can cast spells added in this way only while
the phantom is confined within her consciousness (not
stranded on the Ethereal Plane or fully manifested).
This ability replaces spiritual interference and greater
spiritual interference.

PROMETHEAN DISCIPLE
(ALCHEMIST DISCOVERY)
Some alchemists dabble in the art of construct creation.
Promethean Disciple: An alchemist with this discovery
learns how to craft constructs by way of alchemical
research rather than arcane magic. The alchemist gains
Craft Construct as a bonus feat without needing to meet
its requirements. The alchemist substitutes his number of
ranks in Craft (alchemy) for his total caster level and must
use Craft (alchemy) to create the construct. The DC to create
the construct still increases for any necessary spells that
the alchemist does not have access to (Pathfinder RPG Core
Rulebook 549). However, the alchemist can use extracts in
place of spells as spell prerequisites. An alchemist must be
at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.
ECTOCHYMIST
(ALCHEMIST ARCHETYPE)
Ectochymists study the effects of alchemy on soul and spirit,
focusing on fighting ghosts and other incorporeal creatures.
Class Skills: An ectochymist adds Knowledge (religion) to
his list of class skills. This alters the alchemist’s class skills.
Ectoplasmic Blanche (Su): An ectochymist can
alchemically treat a melee weapon so that it deals full
damage to incorporeal creatures. The process requires a
full-round action and lasts until the next time that weapon
is used to make an attack. An ectochymist can use this ability
a number of times per day equal to his alchemist level + his
Intelligence modifier. This ability replaces bombs.
Cool-Headed (Ex): At 2nd level, an ectochymist gains a
+2 bonus on saves against death, fear, and negative energy
effects. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at
8th level. This ability replaces poison resistance.
Advanced Ectochymistry (Su): At 2nd level, a weapon
coated in an ectochymist’s ectoplasmic blanche also deals
full damage to haunts. This ability replaces poison use.
Swift Ectochymistry (Su): At 6th level, an ectochymist
can use ectoplasmic blanche on one of his own weapons
as a swift action. When coated on a weapon wielded by the
ectochymist, ectoplasmic blanche lasts for a number of
attacks equal to the ectochymist’s Intelligence modifier
(minimum 1 attack). This ability replaces swift poisoning.
Ghost Trap (Su): At 8th level, an ectochymist can throw
a trap to capture an incorporeal creature of up to 1 Hit Die
per alchemist level he possesses. As a standard action, the
ectochymist can expend a use of ectoplasmic blanche to
coat the inside of a container with his blanche and throw
it at an incorporeal creature as a ranged touch attack. If he
hits, the creature receives a Will save to escape the trap (DC
= 10 + 1/2 his alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier).
If the creature fails its save, it is sealed within the vessel
until someone breaks or opens that vessel. The ghost trap
automatically survives being thrown at the incorporeal
creature, but otherwise is only as durable as the vessel
(normally hardness 5, 1 hp for a glass bottle).This ability
replaces the 8th-level alchemist discovery.
Ectochymical Analysis (Sp): At 10th level, an ectochymist
can use alchemical processes to uncover esoteric
knowledge from a haunted area that would normally
require divinations to ascertain. This process takes 10
minutes and expends one use of ectoplasmic blanche.
Treat this effect as speak with hauntAPG with a saving throw
DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the ectochymist’s class level + the
ectochymist’s Charisma modifier and a caster level equal
to the ectochymist’s class level. Because the ectochymist
is performing an analysis to answer his questions and not
speaking with the haunt directly, he uses Craft (alchemy)
rather than Sense Motive to oppose any Bluff checks the
spirit might attempt in order to mislead him. This ability
replaces poison immunity.
Discoveries: The following discoveries complement
the ectochymist archetype: alchemical simulacrumUM,
cognatogenUM, grand cognatogenUM, greater alchemical
simulacrumUM, and mummificationUM.
PROMETHEAN ALCHEMIST
(ALCHEMIST ARCHETYPE)
Obsessed with discovering the origins of life, promethean
alchemists build constructs they gradually endow with life.
Craft Construct: At 1st level, a promethean alchemist
gains the promethean disciple discovery (see above). This
ability replaces Brew Potion and Throw Anything.
Homunculus Companion (Ex): At 1st level, a promethean
alchemist gains the service of a homunculus companion. The
means for creating this special homunculus are more exotic
than normal and require investiture of the promethean
alchemist’s own life essence into the homunculus. This
construct generally resembles a small humanoid or child
when first created; the specific appearance is up to its
creator, though a homunculus is always humanoid in shape
and obviously unnatural on close inspection. While every
homunculus companion is absolutely devoted to its master,
some homunculi’s loyalty borders on the unsettling; such
companions jealously protect their masters from threats
or construct strange shrines in their masters’ honor. A
homunculus companion can be of any alignment, even one
that is different from its master’s. A destroyed homunculus
companion can be restored to life by performing a ritual
with its corpse that requires 1 pint of its creator’s blood per
Hit Die of the homunculus and rare materials worth 100 gp
per Hit Die of the homunculus. Performing this ritual takes
1 hour (though it may take some time to gather enough
blood at higher levels, so many promethean alchemists keep
chilled blood samples in storage just in case). A promethean
alchemist can’t take the mutagen or cognatogen discoveries.
This ability replaces bombs and mutagen.
# 113
Discoveries: The following discoveries complement
this archetype: alchemical simulacrumUM, doppelganger
simulacrumUM, and greater alchemical simulacrumUM.

### See page 113 for Homunculus Stuff

# 114
FLESHEATER (BARBARIAN ARCHETYPE)
A f lesheater eats f lesh to create a spiritual bond between
herself and the consumed creature, allowing her to take on
aspects of the creature that served as the meal.
Rage: In additional to the standard bonuses and penalties
of rage, a f lesheater takes a –2 penalty to Intelligence while
raging. The additional benefits and penalties from a
f lesheater’s abilities last only as long as her rage does, and
she cannot use these abilities if they would bring the total
penalty to Intelligence to an amount equal to or greater than
her Intelligence score. This ability alters the rage ability.
One Flesh (Su): At 2nd level when entering a rage, a
f lesheater can spend an additional round of rage and take an
additional –2 penalty to Intelligence to take on a single ability
of the valid consumed creature whose f lesh she ate most
recently. For the purpose of this ability, a valid consumed
creature is any dead animal, dragon, humanoid, or magical
beast that died and was consumed by the f lesheater within
the past 24 hours. She can choose any ability listed under
beast shape I, as long as the creature possessed that ability.
At 5th level, the f lesheater can take on any number of the
creature’s abilities that are listed under beast shape I. At 8th
level, the f lesheater can instead take on one of the creature’s
abilities listed under beast shape II. The flesheater’s
appearance alters to resemble the consumed creature, but
she does not change shape. This is a polymorph effect. This
ability replaces uncanny dodge, improved uncanny dodge,
and the 2nd- and 8th-level rage powers.
Unbound Rage (Su): At 11th level, a f lesheater can draw in
mass from the Ethereal Plane to enlarge herself when she
enters a rage, as long as the creature whose f lesh she last
consumed was at least one size category larger than her base
size. Unbound rage affects her as enlarge person, except she
receives a +4 size bonus to Strength and an additional –2
penalty to Intelligence. This ability replaces greater rage.
Feast (Su): At 14th level, a f lesheater can use her one
f lesh and unbound rage abilities to emulate any one valid
consumed creature of her choice, rather than only the
one she consumed most recently. This ability replaces the
14th-level rage power.
Unbound Form (Su): At 20th level, a f lesheater can use her
one f lesh ability to assume the shape of a valid consumed
creature. This ability functions as alter self, beast shape IV,
form of the dragon III, or giant form II, as appropriate. This is a
polymorph effect. This ability replaces mighty rage.
Rage Powers: The following rage powers complement
the f lesheater archetype: animal fury, beast totemAPG (any),
inspire ferocityAPG, internal fortitude, and terrifying howl.
PHRENOLOGIST (BARD ARCHETYPE)
The phrenologist is an expert at reading creatures’ skulls,
and he learns to use this knowledge to his benefit.
Phrenological Knowledge (Ex): A phrenologist is an
expert at reading creatures’ skulls. He gains Psychic
Sensitivity* as a bonus feat, and he can use the phrenology
skill unlock even if he is untrained in Knowledge (arcana). He adds half his class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge
(arcana) checks for the phrenology occult skill unlock. This
ability replaces bardic knowledge.
# 115
Skull-Versed (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a phrenologist
can use knowledge gleaned from a creature’s skull to tailor
a performance. All creatures on which the phrenologist
has successfully used his phrenology skill unlock take a
–2 penalty on all saving throws against the phrenologist’s
bardic performances. This ability replaces well-versed.
Phrenological Savant: At 10th level, a phrenologist
gains either Psychic Maestro* or Psychic Virtuoso* as a
bonus feat. If he chooses Psychic Maestro, he must select
phrenology as one of his two skill unlocks to use an
additional time. This ability replaces jack-of-all-trades.
Bardic Performance: A phrenologist gains the following
types of bardic performance.
Skull Sonata (Su): At 1st level, a phrenologist learns to use
the resonance of other creatures’ skulls to increase sonic
damage. All enemies within 30 feet of the phrenologist that
have skulls take an amount of additional sonic damage
equal to half the phrenologist’s bard level (minimum 1)
each time they take sonic damage. Skull sonata relies on
audible components. This ability replaces inspire courage.
In Your Head (Sp): At 3rd level, a phrenologist can use his
performance to send his own senses into another’s skull,
as the spell witnessUM (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phrenologist’s
class level + his Charisma modifier). At 11th level, this
performance’s duration increases to 10 minutes per bard
level, and at 19th level, the duration increases to 1 hour
per bard level. In your head relies on audible components.
This ability replaces inspire competence.
Fingers of Fascination (Su): When a phrenologist uses
the fascinate bardic performance, he can send
forth psychic fingers along with his performance,
allowing him to study one of the fascinated creatures
with his phrenology skill unlock without touching
its head physically and without it being helpless,
willing, or paralyzed. This does not spend his daily use
of the phrenology skill unlock. This ability alters fascinate.
SILVER BALLADEER
(BARD ARCHETYPE)
The bright purity of silver makes beautiful music, and its
vibrations are also anathema to unnatural creatures. Some
bards use a mixture of silver-stringed instruments and
esoteric knowledge to battle the dark forces of the world.
Alignment: A silver balladeer must have a good alignment.
This ability alters alignment.
Bardic Performance: A silver balladeer gains the bardic
performances listed below. These bardic performances
all require the use of a silver or silver-stringed
instrument, which costs twice as much as a normal
masterwork instrument.
Break Curse (Su): At 6th level, a silver balladeer can
suppress a single curse affecting an ally within 30 feet that
is able to see and hear her. Each round the silver balladeer
uses break curse, she attempts a Perform check against
the original DC of the curse. If successful, she suppresses
the curse for 1 round. After she has suppressed the curse
for 4 consecutive rounds, she can attempt a caster level
check to remove the curse as if she had cast remove curse.
This ability replaces suggestion.
Holy Vibration (Su): At 9th level, a silver balladeer can
spend a round of bardic performance to make a single
door or a window within 30 feet resonate with a holy
vibration. Undead and creatures with the evil subtype are
unable to open a door or window affected in this way (as
arcane lock) for 10 minutes per bard level. If such a creature
has the incorporeal subtype, it is unable to move through
the affected door or window, or through any walls, f loors,
or ceilings within 20 feet of it. Incorporeal creatures can
attempt Charisma checks to break through areas warded
by holy vibration, using the same break DC as for the
object the creature is trying to move through. This ability
replaces inspire greatness.
Mass Break Curse (Su): At 18th level, a silver balladeer can
suppress all curses among any number of
allies within 30 feet when using break
curse. Every 4 consecutive rounds of using
this performance, the silver balladeer can attempt a caster level check to remove a single curse on a
single ally affected by this performance, as if she had cast
remove curse. This ability replaces mass suggestion.
# 116
Pure Heart (Ex): At 2nd level, a silver balladeer gains
a +4 bonus on saving throws against curses, hexes, and
charm effects. This ability replaces well-versed.
Silver Mastery (Su): At 2nd level, a silver balladeer treats
silver weapons as if they were also cold iron for the purpose
of overcoming damage reduction. Also, alchemical silver
weapons do not impose a penalty on damage rolls when
wielded by a silver balladeer, and a silver balladeer gains a
+1 bonus on attack rolls made with mithral weapons. This
ability replaces the 2nd-level versatile performance.
ORDER OF THE EASTERN STAR
(CAVALIER ORDER)
This cavalier order exists to keep dangerous secrets
hidden from the world and secretly protect the world
against unimaginable threats from beyond the mortal
realms. These cavaliers scout and observe, concerning
themselves not with the trivial pursuit of morality, but
rather with ensuring the survival of society itself.
Edicts: The cavalier must preserve the secrets of his order
while acting to protect civilization against occult threats. He
must thwart the schemes of otherworldly horrors and must
give his order a full accounting of any potential threats.
Challenge: Whenever a cavalier of the order of the
eastern star issues a challenge, he receives a +1 dodge
bonus to AC and a +1 insight bonus on saves against
the attacks and abilities of the target of his challenge.
He must be wearing light armor and carrying no more
than a light load to receive these bonuses. These bonuses
increase by 1 for every 4 class levels the cavalier possesses.
Skills: A cavalier belonging to the order of the eastern
star adds Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (planes) to
his class skills. He can attempt Knowledge (arcana) and
Knowledge (planes) checks untrained. If he has ranks in
these skills, as long as a check involves knowledge of the
occult or supernatural, he receives a bonus on the check
equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).
Feats: A cavalier of this order gains Psychic Sensitivity
as a bonus feat.
Order Abilities: A cavalier belonging to this order gains
the following abilities as he increases in level.
Guarded (Ex): At 2nd level, the cavalier gains DR 1/—
and a +2 morale bonus on saving throws when wearing
light armor or no armor and
fighting defensively or using
Combat Expertise. At 6th level
and every 4 levels thereafter,
this DR increases by 1. He loses
the benefits of this ability if carrying a
medium or heavier load.
Pierce the Guard (Ex): At 8th level, when
attacking with a light or one-handed
weapon, the cavalier ignores the
penalty for fighting defensively or
using Combat Expertise on his first
melee attack roll each round. If fighting
with two weapons, he ignores the penalty
for the first attack with each weapon, as long
as the off-hand weapon is a light weapon.
The cavalier can’t use this ability with
double weapons.
One Purpose (Ex): At 15th level, the
cavalier’s mount shares the benefits of
the cavalier’s guarded ability as long as
both are wearing light or no armor and
carrying no more than a light load.
The cavalier must fight defensively or
use Combat Expertise to grant these
benefits, but the mount need not. In
addition, the mount gains all the benefits
of the cavalier’s challenge, regardless of
what barding it wears.

# 117
ORDER OF THE SHROUD
(CAVALIER ORDER)
Cavaliers of this order seek out and destroy undead and
those who harbor or create them. They scour old crypts,
graveyards, and battlefields to bring eternal rest.
Edicts: The cavalier must protect the common folk from
the scourge of the undead. He must seek out and destroy
the restless dead and give aid to those haunted by them.
He must protect those who cannot defend themselves, and
root out sources that birth the corruption of life and death.
Challenge: Whenever an order of the shroud cavalier
issues a challenge to an undead creature, he receives a
+1 morale bonus on attack rolls against the target of his
challenge for 1 minute. The bonus increases by 1 for every
4 class levels the cavalier possesses.
Skills: An order of the shroud cavalier adds Knowledge
(local) (Int) and Knowledge (religion) (Int) to his list of
class skills. An order of the shroud cavalier can attempt
Knowledge (religion) checks untrained. If he has ranks in
that skill, as long as a Knowledge (religion) check involves
undead or haunts, he receives a bonus on the check equal
to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).
Order Abilities: A cavalier belonging to the order of the
shroud gains the following abilities as he increases in level.
Spiritual Shield (Su): At 2nd level, the cavalier can call upon
the spirits of the fallen for protection. Once per day as an
immediate action when attacked by an undead target of his
challenge, the cavalier can gain a def lection bonus equal to
his Charisma modifier to his AC against that attack. The
cavalier must decide to use this ability before the attack roll.
Destroyer of the Undead (Su): At 8th level, the cavalier’s
weapons are treated as having the cavalier’s alignment
for the purpose of overcoming the damage reduction
of undead creatures. Against an undead target of his
challenge, the cavalier automatically overcomes all
damage reduction that undead possesses.
Stand Against Darkness (Ex or Su): At 15th level, the
cavalier can take revenge on undead that dare strike him
or those he seeks to protect. Whenever an undead creature
that is the subject of his challenge hits the cavalier or an
adjacent ally with a melee attack, the creature provokes
an attack of opportunity from the cavalier. The cavalier
gains a +2 morale bonus on attacks of opportunity
provoked as a result of this ability. If an undead subject of
the cavalier’s challenge threatens a critical hit against the
cavalier, the cavalier gains a def lection bonus equal to his
Charisma modifier against the confirmation roll. This
bonus functions as a supernatural ability.
GHOST RIDER
(CAVALIER ARCHETYPE)
Ghost riders are conf licted warriors who use the powers
of the phantasmal dead even while seeking out and
banishing the corruption of undeath from plagued
communities. Their strange abilities mark them as
outsiders and stoic loners, and they stay in one place only
long enough to help the aff licted before riding off to
unknown destinations.
Ghost Mount (Su): At 1st level, a ghost rider gains
the ability to manifest a special mount of conjured
ectoplasm rather than one of f lesh and bone. This
spectral companion functions like a spiritualist’s
phantom companion, using the ghost rider’s cavalier
level as her effective spiritualist level. The phantom
takes the form of a ghostly creature analogous to one of
a cavalier’s normal mount options for her size and class
level, such as a Large horse for a Medium ghost rider or
a wolf for a Small ghost rider. A ghost rider must choose
a mount that is capable of bearing her weight, that has
four or more legs, and that lacks a f ly speed (although
the GM may allow mounts with a swim speed in certain
environments). The GM might approve other animals as
suitable mounts.
The ghost rider can manifest her ghost mount only
in ectoplasmic form, and she gains the spiritualist’s
etheric tether class feature, applied to her ghost mount.
The mount shares the cavalier’s alignment. Though the
mount cannot speak, it understands its master’s verbal
commands and gains the phantom’s link ability. The
ghost mount has good Fortitude and Ref lex saves, and can
have ranks in any of the following skills: Acrobatics (Dex),
Climb (Str), Escape Artist (Dex), Fly (Dex), Intimidate
(Cha), Perception (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis),
and Swim (Str). The ghost rider’s ghost mount does not
gain the share spells, deliver touch spells, or incorporeal
f light abilities. Ghost mounts do not gain emotional
focus abilities.
The ghost rider does not take an armor check penalty
on Ride checks while riding her mount. The mount is
always considered combat trained, and begins play with
Endurance as a bonus feat.
Ghost Mount Starting Statistics: Type animal (phantom);
Size one size category larger than the ghost rider; Speed
50 ft.; AC +4 natural armor; Attack bite (1d4), 2 hooves
(1d6; this is a secondary natural attack); Ability Scores
Str 16, Dex 13, Con 15, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 6.
This ability replaces mount.
Frightful Gaze (Su): At 1st level, a ghost rider can use
this ability on opponents within 30 feet as a standard
action, which acts as a gaze attack until the ghost rider’s
next turn. Creatures within range that meet the ghost
rider’s gaze must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC
= 10 + 1/2 the ghost rider’s class level + the ghost rider’s
Charisma modifier) or stand paralyzed in fear for 1
round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Creatures
that successfully save against that ghost rider’s frightful
gaze are immune to it for 24 hours. At 9th level, this
ability can affect creatures that are mindless or immune
to mind-affecting effects, though it still counts as a fear
effect. The ghost rider can use this ability a number of
times each day equal to her Charisma modifier.
This ability replaces tactician, greater tactician, and
master tactician.
# 118
Fearless (Su): At 3rd level, a ghost rider becomes
immune to fear. Each ally within 10 feet of the ghost
rider gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against
fear effects. This ability functions only while the ghost
rider is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead. This
ability replaces cavalier’s charge.
Spirited Mount (Su): At 5th level, the ghost rider’s
mount ignores difficult terrain. At 8th level, it gains
the ability to use water walk at will. This ability replaces
expert trainer and banner.
Ghost Wind (Su): At 11th level, the ghost rider’s ghost
mount can use air walk (as the spell, no action required)
at will for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to
the ground. At 14th level, the mount can f ly at its speed
with a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to the ghost rider’s
class level. This ability replaces mighty charge and
greater banner.
SENSATE
(FIGHTER ARCHETYPE)
A sensate perceives battle through
senses beyond mortal ken, anticipating
his opponents’ movements before they
even begin to act. As long as he keeps
his focus about him, he f ights with a skill
rivaling that of the f inest masters-at-arms.
Skills: The sensate’s class skills are
Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int),
Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride
(Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Survival (Wis),
and Swim (Str). This replaces the fighter’s
class skills.
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Sensates
are proficient with all simple and martial
weapons, light armor, medium armor,
and shields (except tower shields). This
replaces the fighter’s weapon and
armor proficiency.
Guarded Senses (Su): At 2nd level,
a sensate gains a +1 bonus on saves
against sonic effects, figments,
glamers, patterns, gaze attacks, and
scent-based attacks. This bonus
increases by 1 for every 4 levels the
sensate possesses beyond 2nd.
This ability replaces bravery.
Uncanny Dodge (Su): At 3rd level, a sensate gains
uncanny dodge as the barbarian ability of the same name,
except supernatural in nature. This ability replaces
armor training 1.
Centered Senses (Su): At 5th level, a sensate can center
his senses as a move action. While centered, a sensate
gains a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage
rolls, and Will saves. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th
level and every 4 levels thereafter. A sensate loses his
centered state if he gains the confused, dazed, fascinated,
staggered, or stunned condition; falls unconscious; or
fails a Will save. This ability replaces weapon training 2,
3, and 4.
Improved Uncanny Dodge (Su): At 7th level, a sensate
gains improved uncanny dodge as the barbarian ability
of the same name, except supernatural in nature. This
ability replaces armor training 2.
Evasion (Su): At 11th level, a sensate gains evasion
while using centered senses. This functions as the rogue
ability of the same name, except that it is supernatural in
nature and works regardless of the sensate’s armor and
encumbrance. This ability replaces armor training 3.
Steady (Su): At 15th level, a sensate can center himself
as a swift action. This ability replaces armor training 4.
Perfect Senses (Su): At 19th level, a sensate’s senses reach
perfection, and he can easily notice illusions and unseen
foes by combining his senses. While centered, he gains
the effects of true seeing as well as blindsense 60 feet. An
unseen creature that makes no sound and leaves
no scent (such as a creature under the effects
of invisibility, silence, and negate aroma) can still
avoid both the true seeing and the blindsense.
This ability replaces armor mastery.
Precision (Su): At 20th level, a sensate
rolls twice to confirm critical hits while
centered, taking the more favorable
result. Opponents must roll twice
to confirm critical hits against him,
taking the less favorable result. The
latter ability does not function
when the sensate is denied his
Dexterity bonus. This ability
replaces weapon mastery.
# 119
RELIC HUNTER
(INQUISITOR ARCHETYPE)
Some inquisitors specialize in the use and recovery of
long-lost relics of their faiths, drawing forth divine
might from the recovered items in order to restore their
sanctity and wield these artifacts against the enemies of
their gods.
Spells: A relic hunter casts divine spells drawn from
the inquisitor spell list, but her chosen relic schools (see
Relics below) limit her to schools she knows, similar
in function to an occultist’s implements. Any spell or
orison gained by the relic hunter has a relic component
(see Relics below), and is not considered to be on the relic
hunter’s spell list until she selects its school though the
relics alternate class feature. Once she chooses a school,
all spells and orisons of that school are considered to
be on the relic hunter’s class spell list, allowing her to
use spell trigger and spell completion magic items of
those spells. A relic hunter’s spells per day, daily spell
allotment, Difficulty Class, and minimum Wisdom score
requirements remain unchanged from the inquisitor’s
normal spellcasting class feature. This ability alters the
inquisitor’s spellcasting.
Relics (Su): At 1st level, a relic hunter gains the occultist’s
implements class feature (see page 47) and learns to use two
occultist implement schools as relic schools. At 4th level
and every 3 levels thereafter, the relic hunter learns to use
one additional relic school drawn from the same source,
gaining access to that school’s resonant power and base
focus power and opening up that school’s focus powers for
her to select. Like an occultist, a relic hunter can select the
same school twice, but it is far less useful for her to do so.
Relics do not need to be magic items, and nonmagical
relics do not take up a magic item slot. Relics that are
not magic items are often of some religious significance
to the relic hunter or her church, such as the battered
shield of a saint, a bishop’s robe, or the finger bone of a
church martyr.
This ability replaces judgment.
Deific Focus (Su): At 1st level, a relic hunter learns
to invest divine power into her chosen relics. This acts
like the occultist’s focus powers and mental focus class
features (see pages 47 and 48, respectively), with the
following adjustments.
Each day, a relic hunter has a number of points of deific
focus equal to her inquisitor level + her Wisdom modifier,
and she must spend 1 hour in prayer with her relics to
invest them with divine power. These points refresh at
the start of each day.
At 1st level, the relic hunter learns the two base focus
powers from her chosen relic schools and can select one
more focus power from the list of those made available
by her chosen schools. Whenever she gains a new relic
school, she gains the base focus power of that school.
In addition, at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter,
she learns a new focus power selected from all of the
powers granted by all of the relic schools she knows.
She can use these focus powers only by expending
points of deif ic focus. Unless otherwise noted, the DC
for any saving throws against a focus power is equal
to 10 + 1/2 the inquisitor’s class level + the inquisitor’s
Wisdom modif ier. She cannot select a focus power more
than once. She uses her inquisitor level in place of an
occultist level to qualify for focus powers.
This ability replaces domain, bane, greater bane,
second judgment, and third judgment.
PSYCHIC DETECTIVE
(INVESTIGATOR ARCHETYPE)
A psychic detective supplements her keen insight
with occult skill to unravel mysteries both ordinary
and supernatural.
Class Skills: The psychic detective does not receive
Acrobatics, Climb, or Perform as class skills. This alters
the investigator’s class skills.
Spells: A psychic detective casts psychic spells drawn
from the psychic class spell list (see page 69) and
augmented by a select set of additional spells (see Psychic
Detective Spells on page 120). Only spells from the psychic
class spell list of 6th level or lower and psychic detective
spells are considered to be part of the psychic detective’s
spell list. If a spell appears on both the psychic detective
and psychic class spell lists, the psychic detective uses
the spell level from the psychic detective spell list. She
can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead
of time. To learn or cast a spell, a psychic detective must
have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell’s
level. The saving throw DC against a psychic detective’s
spell is 10 + the spell’s level + the psychic detective’s
Intelligence modifier.
Like other spellcasters, a psychic detective can cast
only a certain number of spells of each spell level per
day. She knows the same number of spells and receives
the same number of spells slots per day as a bard of her
investigator level, and knows and uses 0-level knacks as a
bard uses cantrips. In addition, she receives bonus spells
per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1–3
on page 17 of the Core Rulebook).
At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a psychic
detective can choose to learn a new spell in place of
one she already knows, using the same rules as a bard.
In effect, the psychic detective loses the old spell in
exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be
the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must
be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell the
psychic detective can cast.
A psychic detective need not prepare her spells in
advance. She can cast any psychic detective spell she
knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her
allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level.
# 120
Psychic Detective Spells: A psychic detective has the
following spells on her spell list, in addition to psychic
spells of 6th level or lower.
1st—Detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, find traps.
3rd—Calm spirit*, daylight.
4th—Modify memory.
6th—Banishment, moment of prescience, scrying (greater).
This ability replaces alchemy.
Psychic Meddler (Su): At 2nd level, a psychic detective
receives a +1 bonus on saves against psychic spells and
spell-like abilities. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level
and every 3 levels thereafter, to a maximum of +6 at
17th level. Starting at 5th level, the psychic investigator
adds half this bonus on caster level checks to dispel
psychic effects. This ability replaces poison lore, poison
resistance, swift alchemy, and poison immunity.
Phrenic Dabbler (Su): At 3rd level, a psychic detective
gains a small pool of phrenic points equal to 1/2
her psychic detective level, as well as one phrenic
amplif ication, as the psychic class feature. This does
not allow the psychic detective to qualify for the Extra
Amplif ication feat. This ability replaces the investigator
talent gained at 3rd level.
Investigator Talents: A psychic detective selects
investigator talents as normal, except she cannot select
the alchemist discovery investigator talent. She can select
the Expanded Phrenic Pool* feat as a discovery even though
she doesn’t meet that feat’s prerequisites, and she can
select an extra phrenic amplification once as a discovery.
The following investigator talents, which can be found
on pages 32–34 of the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide,
complement the psychic detective archetype: confusing
strike, device talent, effortless aid, hidden agendas,
inspired intelligence, item lore, and unconventional
inspiration. This ability alters investigator talents.
ESOTERIC (MAGUS ARCHETYPE)
Esoterics are drawn to the mysticism of the occult
and spend their lives delving into forgotten texts and
forbidden tomes. Each esoteric learns to inscribe his
spells on his f lesh in a complex series of occult symbols
and arcane equations.
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: An esoteric is
proficient with simple weapons only. This alters the
magus’s weapon and armor proficiency.
Diminished Spellcasting: An esoteric has one fewer
spell slot of each level than a regular magus. If this
reduces his number of spell slots of a particular level to
zero, he can cast spells of that level only if his Intelligence
allows bonus spells of that level. This ability alters the
magus’s spellcasting.
Arcane Pool (Su): At 1st level, an esoteric can use his
arcane pool to enhance his unarmed strikes as if they
were manufactured weapons. At 5th level, he can use these
bonuses to add any of the following weapon special
abilities to his weapons or unarmed
strikes: defending, f laming, f laming
burst, frost, icy burst, impactUM, shock,
shocking burst, speed, or thundering.
This ability alters arcane pool.
Unarmed Strike: At 1st level, an
esoteric gains Improved Unarmed Strike
as a bonus feat. He also treats his magus
levels as monk levels when determining the
amount of damage he deals with his unarmed strikes.
Unarmed Spellstrike (Su): At 1st level, an esoteric
gains the magus spellstrike class feature. However, an
esoteric can deliver spells with spellstrike only with his
unarmed strikes. This ability alters spellstrike.
Ki Arcana (Su): At 4th level, an esoteric’s arcane pool
is also considered a ki pool for the purposes of meeting
feat and ability requirements. Points from an esoteric’s
arcane pool can be used for abilities that normally require
ki. If an esoteric gains a ki pool, he can use points from
his arcane pool and ki pool interchangeably (though not
special points such as drunken ki). This ability replaces
spell recall.
# 121
Tattooed Spell (Sp): At 5th level and every 6 levels
thereafter, an esoteric can permanently tattoo one
spell from his magus spellbook onto his body; the
f irst tattooed spell must be of 2nd level or lower, the
second must be of 4th level or lower, and the last can
be of any level. The spell that is tattooed must not
have an expensive material component or a focus. The
esoteric can prepare any tattooed spell without needing
his spellbook. Additionally, he can cast each of his
tattooed spells as a spell-like ability once per day. When
the esoteric uses these spell-like abilities, the tattoo
associated with the spell-like ability glows as light for a
number of rounds equal to the spell’s level. This ability
replaces bonus feats.
AC Bonus (Ex): At 7th level when an esoteric wears light
or no armor, he gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and CMD.
This bonus increases by 1 at 13th level. He loses these
bonuses while immobilized or helpless, or while wearing
medium or heavy armor, using a shield, or carrying a
medium or heavy load. This ability replaces medium
armor and heavy armor.
Improved Tattooed Spell (Sp): At 11th level, an esoteric
can use each of his spell-like abilities from tattooed
spell one additional time per day. This ability replaces
improved spell recall.
MINDBLADE (MAGUS ARCHETYPE)
A mindblade blends psychic talent and martial skill to
lethal effect. By forming weapons with her mind, she
always has the right tool for any situation.
Spells: A mindblade casts spells from the magus spell
list as psychic spells. She can cast any spell she knows
without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a
spell, a mindblade must have an Intelligence score equal
to at least 10 + the spell’s level. The saving throw DC
to resist a mindblade’s spell is equal to 10 + the spell’s
level + the mindblade’s Intelligence modifier.
Like other spellcasters, a mindblade can cast only a
certain number of spells of each spell level per day. She
knows the same number of spells and receives the same
number of spells slots per day as a bard of her magus
level, and knows and uses 0-level knacks as a bard uses
cantrips. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if
she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1–3 on page 17
of the Core Rulebook).
At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mindblade
can learn a new spell in place of one she already knows,
using the same rules as a bard. In effect, the mindblade
loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new
spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being
exchanged, and the new spell must be at least 1 level lower
than the highest-level spell the mindblade can cast.
A mindblade need not prepare her spells in advance.
She can cast any magus spell she knows at any time,
assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells
per day for the spell’s level.
This ability replaces the magus’s spellcasting.
Psychic Pool (Su): A mindblade gains a psychic pool,
similar to a normal magus’s arcane pool. At 1st level,
a mindblade can expend 1 point from her psychic pool
as a standard action to manifest a light melee weapon
of her choice, formed from psychic energy. By spending
2 points, the mindblade can manifest a one-handed
melee weapon, and by spending 3 points, she can
manifest a two-handed melee weapon (but not a double
weapon). This psychic weapon can last indef initely,
but it vanishes if it leaves the mindblade’s hand. The
mindblade can dismiss a held psychic weapon as a free
action. When a psychic weapon vanishes, the mindblade
regains the psychic energy used to create it. She can
maintain only one weapon at a time.
At 1st level, a psychic weapon counts as a magic
weapon of whatever type the mindblade selected, with
a +1 enhancement bonus. At 3rd level and every 3 levels
thereafter, the weapon’s enhancement bonus increases
by 1, up to maximum of +5 at 12th level. Starting at 5th
level, the mindblade can add any of the weapon special
abilities listed in the arcane pool class feature in place
of these bonuses, although the weapon must maintain
at least a +1 bonus to benefit from any weapon special
abilities. At 15th and 18th levels, the weapon gains an
additional +1 enhancement bonus, which the mindblade
can spend only on weapon special abilities.
This ability replaces arcane pool, and counts as arcane
pool for the purpose of feats, abilities, and class features.
Psychic Access (Su): At 4th level, the mindblade gains
access to an expanded spell list. She adds two spells
from the psychic class spell list to her magus spell list
as magus spells of the same spell level. These must be
spells of levels the mindblade is able to cast. At 7th, 11th,
14th, and 19th levels, she adds two more psychic class
spells to her spell list, following the same restrictions.
When a mindblade takes the spell blending arcana, she
gains spells from the psychic class spell list instead of
the wizard spell list.
This ability replaces spell recall, knowledge pool,
improved spell recall, greater spell combat, and greater
spell access.
Dual Weapons (Su): At 7th level, a mindblade can
maintain two psychic weapons at a time or a psychic
double weapon, though each weapon (or each end of a
double weapon) has an enhancement bonus 1 lower than
normal. Starting at 12th level, each of the two psychic
weapons (or each end of a double weapon) instead has an
enhancement bonus 2 lower than normal. When using
two-weapon fighting with two psychic weapons or a
psychic double weapon, the mindblade can use her spell
combat ability as though she had a hand free. This ability
replaces medium armor.
# 122
Rapid Manifest (Su): At 8th level, a mindblade can
manifest a psychic weapon as a swift action. This ability
replaces improved spell combat.
Dual Manifest (Su): At 13th level, a mindblade can
manifest two psychic weapons with the same action. She
must pay the cost for both weapons. Also, when wielding a
weapon two-handed, she can use her spell combat ability
as though she had a hand free. This ability replaces
heavy armor.
KARMIC MONK
(MONK ARCHETYPE)
A karmic monk contemplates the myriad harmonies
that guide existence. He learns to use the
disharmony in others against them,
and to alter his own inner harmonies
to exploit weaknesses in his
opponents’ defenses.
Alignment: A karmic monk
must be true neutral or of any
lawful alignment. This alters the
monk’s alignment requirement.
Class Skills: The karmic monk gains
Diplomacy (Cha) as a class skill instead
of Intimidate. This alters the monk’s
class skills.
Karmic Strike (Su): At 1st
level, a karmic monk gains
bonuses against creatures
that attack him first. If a
creature the karmic monk
has not attacked within the past
24 hours makes an attack roll
against the karmic monk or casts
an offensive spell that affects the
karmic monk, the karmic monk
receives a +2 bonus on attack rolls and
damage rolls against that creature. If
the karmic monk hits such a target, this
bonus lasts until the end of the karmic
monk’s turn (or until the beginning of
the karmic monk’s next turn, if it isn’t
his turn). Otherwise, the bonus against
a particular creature lasts for 1 minute
after the creature’s last attack against
the karmic monk. This ability replaces
stunning f ist.
Balanced Mind (Su): At 3rd level, a karmic monk
receives a +2 bonus on saving throws against effects with
the chaos, evil, good, or law subtype. He also receives this
bonus against the abilities and effects of creatures of the
listed subtypes. This ability replaces still mind.
Ki Pool (Su): At 7th level, when a karmic monk makes
unarmed strikes, they’re treated as chaotic, evil, good,
and lawful. This ability replaces the 7th- and 10th-level
ki pool abilities.
Harmony (Su): At 9th level, as an immediate action,
a karmic monk can shift his alignment by one step for
the purpose of all effects dependent on alignment until
the beginning of his next turn. This does not actually
alter the karmic monk’s alignment. This ability replaces
improved evasion.
Karmic Disruption (Su): At 16th level, a karmic monk
can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action to
add 1d6 points of damage to his unarmed strikes against
creatures of either chaotic, evil, good, or lawful alignment
for 1 round. This stacks with other abilities that
deal damage based on alignment. He cannot
alter his alignment choice until the next
time he uses this ability.
Creatures that are of the
appropriate alignment
and are struck by this
attack must succeed at a
Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the
karmic monk’s class level +
the karmic monk’s Wisdom
modifier) or lose any damage
reduction based on alignment
for a number of rounds equal
to the karmic monk’s Wisdom modifier
(minimum 1 round). A creature that succeeds
at this save is immune to having its damage
reduction disrupted by that karmic monk for
24 hours. This attack disrupts only alignment
components of damage reduction, not any
other components; for example, DR/cold
iron and good becomes DR/cold iron.
This ability replaces slow fall 80 feet,
and alters slow fall at 19th level to become
slow fall 80 feet.
Harmonic Self: At 20th level,
a karmic monk is truly in tune
with the harmonic balance of the
universe. He gains the abilities
of perfect self, except that
instead of DR 10/chaotic, he gains
DR 10 that is overcome only by attacks
that do not count as chaotic, evil, good, or
lawful. This ability alters perfect self.

# 123
GHOST HUNTER
(PALADIN ARCHETYPE)
Ghost hunters devote their lives to eliminating
malevolent spirits and putting them to rest.
Ghostly Smite (Su): A ghost hunter’s smite evil ability
does not automatically bypass DR (other than DR/good).
However, she treats her weapon as a ghost touch weapon
against the target of her smite. She does not deal extra
damage on the first attack against evil outsiders and evil
dragons, but she deals 3 points of damage per paladin
level she possesses to undead creatures on the first attack
(instead of 2 points). This ability alters smite evil.
Exorcise Possession (Su): At 6th level, a ghost hunter
can try to end any possession spells or effects, or effects
that directly exercise mental control over a creature.
She must touch the affected creature (this requires a
melee touch attack if the target is neither willing nor
helpless) and expend a use of her lay on hands ability.
The target can immediately attempt a Will save against
the original save DC of the controlling effect. If the
save is successful, the effect immediately ends, as if the
target had succeeded at its original saving throw. This
ability replaces the 6th-level mercy.
Speak to the Restless (Sp): At 9th level, a ghost hunter
can commune with the spirits of the restless dead once
per day. By holding a seance for 10 minutes, she can
ask questions of a destroyed undead or a neutralized
or destroyed haunt. To use this ability on a corporeal
undead, the ghost hunter must have the creature’s head
in her possession. For a haunt or incorporeal undead,
this seance must be held in the haunt’s location or
where the incorporeal undead was destroyed. Treat this
ability as speak with hauntACG or as speak with dead (but
affecting only undead rather than only corpses), using
the ghost hunter’s class level as the caster level. This
ability replaces the 9th-level mercy.
ESCAPOLOGIST
(ROGUE ARCHETYPE)
	DESC:The escapologist excels at escaping any conf inement, whether physical, magical, or mental. Few restraints can hold an escapologist for long.
Elusive: An escapologist adds 1/2 her rogue level (minimum +1) as a bonus on all Disable Device and Escape Artist checks. An escapologist can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps. This ability replaces trapfinding, but counts as trapfinding for the purposes of prerequisites and abilities that require trapfinding.
Unfettered Mind (Su): At 3rd level, an escapologist can attempt an Escape Artist check as a full-round action to remove a mind-affecting effect currently affecting her. The DC of this check is equal to the effect’s original save DC + 20. She cannot remove effects that do not allow a saving throw. She can attempt to escape even if paralyzed or restrained, as long as she can take purely mental actions. She can attempt this check against a particular effect once per round if the effect is measured in rounds, once per minute if the effect is measured in minutes, once per 10 minutes if the effect is measured in 10-minute intervals, and so on. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.
Impossible Escape (Su): At 8th level, as an immediate action, an escapologist can attempt an Escape Artist check at a –10 penalty and apply the result in place of either a failed Ref lex save or her AC against an attack that would have hit her. If she succeeds, her contortions let her avoid the attack or effect entirely. Using this ability leaves the escapologist staggered until the end of her next turn. If the escapologist can’t become staggered, she can’t use impossible escape. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.
FALSE MEDIUM
(ROGUE ARCHETYPE)
	DESC:The false medium is a master of pretending to have occult powers in order to manipulate the emotions and atmosphere of the people and places around him, often reaping a healthy reward from the bereaved, who find solace in his comforting lies.
Dim the Lights (Ex): At 1st level, while in dim light or darkness, a false medium adds 1/2 his rogue level as a bonus on Bluff, Disguise, and Sleight of Hand checks, and creatures without low-light vision or darkvision take an equal penalty on skill checks to oppose the false medium’s Bluff, Disguise, and Sleight of Hand checks. This ability replaces trapfinding.
False Sensitivity (Ex): At 2nd level, a charlatan can convincingly fake the ability to use occult skill unlocks such as automatic writing and dowsing. An untrained onlooker can’t tell the difference between the false medium’s scams and a true use of occult skill unlocks. An onlooker capable of using the particular occult skill unlock that the false medium is faking can attempt the appropriate skill check for that unlock, opposed by the false medium’s Bluff check, to detect the fraud. In any case, any results of the false medium’s charades are fabricated (for instance, the false medium might ask leading questions to elicit false memories while pretending to use hypnotism). This ability replaces the 2nd-level rogue talent.
Haunting Presences (Ex): At 3rd level, the false medium exploits his natural talent for deception to convince others of the presence of false supernatural entities. As long as the false medium is in conditions of dim light or darkness, he can use Bluff skill checks to emulate the effects of dancing lights, ghost sound, silent image, or ventriloquism by throwing his voice, subtly misdirecting or convincing subjects, or manipulating light and shadows. The range of these effects is 10 feet from the false medium, plus an additional 5 feet for every 3 rogue levels he possesses beyond 3rd. The effects last for 1 round, though they can be maintained with additional checks. Only one of these effects can be created or maintained in a given round. Observers can attempt either a Perception or Sense Motive check (whichever of their bonuses is higher) to oppose this Bluff check; the GM should roll these checks secretly. This is an extraordinary ability and not an illusion, so if the false medium succeeds at the opposed check, even powerful effects like true seeing don’t detect the fakery. This ability replaces trap sense.
# 124
ECTOPLASM
(SORCERER BLOODLINE)
	DESC:Your family has a connection with the ethereal substance known as ectoplasm, whether from communing with the spirits or battling the spiritual undead. The power of the Ethereal Plane thrums in your mind and pulls at your f lesh.
	DESC:&nl;Class Skill: Stealth.
	DESC:&nl;Bonus Spells: Obscuring mist (3rd), ghost whip* (5th), ectoplasmic snare* (7th), spirit-bound blade* (9th), wall of ectoplasm* (11th), ethereal jaunt (13th), ectoplasmic eruption* (15th), create demiplane (17th), etherealness (19th).
	DESC:&nl;Bonus Feats: Blind-Fight, Dodge, Ectoplasmic SpellAPG, Lingering SpellAPG, Silent Spell, Skill Focus (Fly), Skill Focus (Stealth), Spell Focus.
	DESC:&nl;Bloodline Arcana: Incorporeal creatures take 75% of the normal amount of damage from your damaging spells, and when incorporeal creatures attempt saving throws against your non-damaging spells, they roll twice and must take the lower result.
	DESC:&nl;Bloodline Powers: You can control and emit ectoplasm, leaving you less grounded in the physical world.
Entangling Ectoplasm (Sp): At 1st level, you can create a ball of ectoplasm and hurl it at targets within 30 feet. This ectoplasm acts as a tanglefoot bag that can also entangle incorporeal creatures. The ectoplasm dissipates within 1d3 rounds. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.
Ectoplasmic Reach (Su): At 3rd level, you can exude small tendrils of ectoplasm that can be used to make melee touch attacks as part of a spell with a range of touch. You can make melee touch attacks as if you had an additional 5 feet of reach. You must have a free hand with which to direct the ectoplasm. This ability does not otherwise increase your threatened area. At 11th level, this additional reach increases to 10 feet. At 17th level, this additional reach increases to 15 feet.
Ectoplasmic Form (Sp): At 9th level, you can transform into a cloud of ectoplasm. Treat this as gaseous form, except that you can f ly at a speed of 30 feet, and you can solidify your form sufficiently to carry small objects, though fine manipulation is impossible. You can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to your sorcerer level. These minutes need not be consecutive, but must be used in 1-minute increments.
Malevolent Ectoplasm (Sp): At 15th level, your ectoplasmic tendrils can lash out at creatures around you. Treat this  as a black tentacles effect centered on your position, but the tentacles can also grapple ethereal and incorporeal creatures, and they do not affect you (though they still affect your allies). You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to your sorcerer level. These rounds need not be consecutive.
# 125
Ectoplasmic Body (Ex): At 20th level, you are more ectoplasm than f lesh. You become immune to sneak attacks and critical hits and gain DR 5/slashing.
PSYCHIC (SORCERER BLOODLINE)
	DESC:Psychic power runs thorough your blood, whether it be from a familial predisposition to psychic power or exposure to a powerful psychic phenomenon. Whatever the source of this power, your mind is a dangerous weapon.
	DESC:&nl;Class Skill: Sense Motive.
	DESC:&nl;Bonus Spells: Mind thrust I* (3rd), id insinuation I* (5th), ego whip I* (7th), intellect fortress I* (9th), psychic crush I* (11th), mental barrier V* (13th), tower of iron will III* (15th), bilocation* (17th), microcosm* (19th).
	DESC:&nl;Bonus Feats: Focused SpellAPG, Heighten Spell, Intuitive Spell*, Iron Will, Logical Spell*, Persuasive, Quicken Spell, Skill Focus (Sense Motive), Spell Focus.
Bloodline Arcana: Your sorcerer spells and spell-like abilities count as psychic instead of arcane. You use thought and emotion components instead of verbal and somatic components when casting your spells.
Bloodline Powers: Your psychic powers make you a master mentalist, but your soul struggles with the urge to transcend into a pure thought-form.
Psychic Strike (Su): At 1st level, you can overwhelm the minds of those nearby. You can target one creature within 30 feet that you can see; that creature must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier) or it takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point for every 2 sorcerer levels you possess and becomes shaken for 1 round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.
Mental Resistance (Ex): At 3rd level, your mind blocks attempts to assail it. You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. At 9th level, this bonus increases to +4.
Undercasting Prodigy (Sp): Starting at 9th level, whenever you gain a new level of spells, you automatically replace any psychic bloodline spells that can be undercast with the highest-level version you can cast in your list of spells known. For example, at 9th level, you would replace mind thrust I, id insinuation I, and ego whip I with mind thrust IV, id insinuation III, and ego whip II, respectively, as spells known.
Thoughtsense (Sp): At 15th level, you can detect the thoughts of others around you, as a constant thoughtsense* effect with a range of 30 feet instead of 60 feet. True Thought-Form (Sp): At 20th level, you can shed the restrictions of the f lesh and become a thoughtform— a being that exists independently of its substance. Whenever a creature would kill you, you can attempt to use mind swap* against that creature as an immediate action just before dying.
# WITCH PATRONS
# Some witches draw their spells from mysterious patrons connected to the mind or the Ethereal Plane. Such esoteric patrons grant unusual powers for their own strange and inscrutable reasons.
# COMMENT: Witch Spells not set up yet
Ethereal	KEY:Witch Patron ~ Ethereal	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitchPatron	DESC: 2nd—detect undead, 4th—see invisibility, 6th— ectoplasmic snare*, 8th—condensed ether*, 10th—ethereal envelope*, 12th—ethereal jaunt, 14th—ectoplasmic eruption*, 16th—ethereal envelopment*, 18th—etherealness.

LEY LINE GUARDIAN (WITCH ARCHETYPE)
	DESC:Some witches tap into the power of their patrons not through a special connection with a familiar, but rather directly through the vast network of ley lines that crosses the planes. These witches can harness the latent powers of ley lines without even needing to be near one of the points where ley lines’ powers are accessible to mortal spellcasters.
Ley Line Powered: Instead of preparing her spells, a ley line guardian draws the power casting spells directly from ley lines. A ley line guardian is a spontaneous spellcaster. She knows the same number of spells and receives the same number of spell slots per day as a sorcerer of her witch level. Bonus spells granted by a ley line guardian’s patron are added to the ley line guardian’s total spells known at the appropriate levels. This ability alters the witch’s spellcasting.
Conduit Surge (Su): At 1st level, a ley line guardian is adept at channeling energy from ley lines to enhance her own spells. As a swift action, she can increase her effective caster level for the next spell she casts in that round by 1d4–1 levels. After performing a conduit surge, the ley line guardian must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + level of spell cast + number of additional caster levels granted) or become staggered for a number of minutes equal to the level of the spell cast. At 8th level, the caster level increase becomes 1d4. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modif ier. This ability replaces familiar and the hexes gained at 1st and 8th levels.
