Elemental Focus			KEY:Kineticist ~ Elemental Focus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DEFINE:Pool_KineticistElementalFocus|0	DESC:At 1st level, a kineticist chooses one primary element on which to focus. This element determines how she accesses the raw power of the Ethereal Plane, and grants her access to specific wild talents (see below) and additional class skills. She can select aether (telekinesis), air (aerokinesis), earth (geokinesis), fire (pyrokinesis), or water (hydrokinesis). She gains her selected element's basic utility wild talent (basic telekinesis, basic aerokinesis, basic geokinesis, basic pyrokinesis, or basic hydrokinesis; see page 23) as a bonus wild talent. See Elements on page 14 for the specific abilities granted by each element.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		BONUS:VAR|Pool_KineticistElementalFocus|0	SOURCEPAGE:p.10
Wild Talents			KEY:Kineticist ~ Wild Talents				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality										DESC:A kineticist can use wild talents-magical abilities similar to spells but drawn from the kineticist's innate psychic talent and usable at will. Wild talents are typically spell-like abilities (though some are supernatural abilities), and take a standard action to use unless otherwise noted. A wild talent always has the elemental descriptor or descriptors (aether, air, earth, fire, or water) matching its Element entry. A wild talent that can be used with any of several elements gains the appropriate elemental descriptor when used with an element. For example, the wall wild talent gains the earth descriptor when used by a geokineticist. Every wild talent has an effective spell level. A kineticist can always select 1st-level wild talents, but she can select a wild talent of a higher level only if her kineticist level is at least double the wild talent's effective spell level. Kinetic blast and defense wild talents are always considered to have an effective spell level equal to 1/2 the kineticist's class level (to a maximum effective spell level of 9th at kineticist level 18th). Unless otherwise noted, the DC for a saving throw against a wild talent is equal to 10 + the wild talent's effective spell level + the kineticist's Constitution modifier. The kineticist uses her Constitution modifier on all concentration checks for wild talents. In addition to the wild talents she gains from her other class features, at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a kineticist selects a new utility wild talent from the list of options available to her. A kineticist can select only universal wild talents or those that match her element (see Elemental Focus above). At 6th, 10th, and 16th levels, a kineticist can replace one of her utility wild talents with another wild talent of the same level or lower. She can't replace a wild talent that she used to qualify for another of her wild talents.																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.10
Burn					KEY:Kineticist ~ Burn					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary								DESC:At 1st level, a kineticist can overexert herself to channel more power than normal, pushing past the limit of what is safe for her body by accepting burn. Some of her wild talents allow her to accept burn in exchange for a greater effect, while others require her to accept a certain amount of burn to use that talent at all. For each point of burn she accepts, a kineticist takes 1 point of nonlethal damage per character level. This damage can't be healed by any means other than getting a full night's rest, which removes all burn and associated nonlethal damage. Nonlethal damage from burn can't be reduced or redirected, and a kineticist incapable of taking nonlethal damage can't accept burn. A kineticist can accept only 1 point of burn per round. This limit rises to 2 points of burn at 6th level, and rises by 1 additional point every 3 levels thereafter. A kineticist can't choose to accept burn if it would put her total number of points of burn higher than 3 + her Constitution modifier (though she can be forced to accept more burn from a source outside her control). A kineticist who has accepted burn never benefits from abilities that allow her to ignore or alter the effects she receives from nonlethal damage.																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.11
Kinetic Blast			KEY:Kineticist ~ Kinetic Blast			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike								DESC:At 1st level, a kineticist gains a kinetic blast wild talent of her choice. This kinetic blast must be a simple blast that matches her element. As a standard action, the kineticist can unleash a kinetic blast at a single target up to a range of 30 feet. She must have at least one hand free to aim the blast (or one prehensile appendage, if she doesn't have hands). All damage from a kinetic blast is treated as magic for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. Kinetic blasts count as a type of weapon for the purpose of feats such as Weapon Focus. The kineticist is never considered to be wielding or gripping the kinetic blast (regardless of effects from form infusions; see Infusion on page 12), and she can't use Vital Strike feats with kinetic blasts. Even the weakest kinetic blast involves a sizable mass of elemental matter or energy, so kinetic blasts always deal full damage to swarms of any size (though only area blasts deal extra damage to swarms). A readied kinetic blast can be used to counterspell any spell of equal or lower level that shares its descriptor. A kinetic blast that deals energy damage of any type (including force) has the corresponding descriptor. The various kinetic blasts, as well as additional rules for simple blasts, are described on pages 15-16.																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.11
Gather Power			KEY:Kineticist ~ Gather Power				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:If she has both hands free (or all of her prehensile appendages free, for unusual kineticists), a kineticist can gather energy or elemental matter as a move action. Gathering power creates an extremely loud, visible display in a 20-foot radius centered on the kineticist, as the energy or matter swirls around her. Gathering power in this way allows the kineticist to reduce the total burn cost of a blast wild talent she uses in the same round by 1 point. The kineticist can instead gather power for 1 full round in order to reduce the total burn cost of a blast wild talent used on her next turn by 2 points (to a minimum of 0 points). If she does so, she can also gather power as a move action during her next turn to reduce the burn cost by a total of 3 points. If the kineticist takes damage during or after gathering power and before using the kinetic blast that releases it, she must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 10 + damage taken + effective spell level of her kinetic blast) or lose the energy in a wild surge that forces her to accept a number of points of burn equal to the number of points by which her gathered power would have reduced the burn cost. This ability can never reduce the burn cost of a wild talent below 0 points.																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Infusion				KEY:Kineticist ~ Infusion				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:At 1st level, a kineticist gains an infusion wild talent from the list of options available based on her elemental focus. She gains additional infusions at 3rd, 5th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 17th, and 19th levels. By using infusions along with her kinetic blasts, a kineticist can alter her kinetic blasts to suit her needs. Infusions come in two types, each of which changes a kinetic blast differently: a substance infusion causes an additional effect, while a form infusion causes the kinetic blast to manifest in a different way. Each infusion can alter only certain kinds of kinetic blasts, which are listed in its Associated Blasts entry. Each time the kineticist uses one of her kinetic blast wild talents, she can apply up to one associated form infusion and up to one associated substance infusion. Some infusions change the action required to activate a kinetic blast or entirely transform the kinetic blast's normal effects. The burn cost listed in each infusion's Burn entry is added to the burn cost of the kinetic blast the infusion modifies. The DC for a save against an infusion is based on the associated kinetic blast's effective spell level, not the level of the infusion. The DCs for form infusions are calculated using the kineticist's Dexterity modifier instead of her Constitution modifier. When a kineticist modifies a kinetic blast with a form infusion and a substance infusion that both require saving throws, each target first attempts a saving throw against the form infusion. If a target succeeds and a successful save negates the infusion's effects, the entire kinetic blast is negated; otherwise, the target then attempts a saving throw against the substance infusion. If a kineticist's form and substance infusions both alter the kinetic blast's damage, apply the substance infusion's alteration first. At 5th, 11th, and 17th levels, a kineticist can replace one of her infusions with another infusion of the same effective spell level or lower. She can't replace an infusion that she used to qualify for another of her wild talents. The descriptions of infusions begin on page 17.																				SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Elemental Defense			KEY:Kineticist ~ Elemental Defense			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:At 2nd level, a kineticist gains her element's defense wild talent ( the descriptions of defense wild talents begin on page 16).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Elemental Overflow		KEY:Kineticist ~ Elemental Overflow			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary								DESC:At 3rd level, a kineticist's body surges with energy from her chosen element whenever she accepts burn, causing her to glow with a nimbus of fire, weep water from her pores, or experience some other thematic effect. In addition, she receives a bonus on her attack rolls with kinetic blasts equal to the total number of points of burn she currently has, to a maximum bonus of +1 for every 3 kineticist levels she possesses. She also receives a bonus on damage rolls with her kinetic blast equal to double the bonus on attack rolls. The kineticist can suppress the visual effects of elemental overf low by concentrating for 1 full round, but doing so suppresses all of this ability's other benefits, as well. The next time the kineticist uses any wild talent, the visual effects and benefits return instantly. As a kineticist's body becomes more and more suffused with her element, she begins to gain more powerful benefits. Starting at 6th level, whenever she has at least 3 points of burn, the kineticist gains a +2 size bonus to two physical ability scores of her choice. She also gains a chance to ignore the effects of a critical hit or sneak attack equal to 5%% x her current number of points of burn. At 11th level, whenever the kineticist has at least 5 points of burn, these bonuses increase to a +4 size bonus to one physical ability score of her choice and a +2 size bonus to each of her other two physical ability scores. At 16th level, whenever the kineticist has at least 7 points of burn, these bonuses increase to a +6 size bonus to one physical ability score of her choice, a +4 size bonus to a second physical ability score of her choice, and a +2 size bonus to the remaining physical ability score.																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Infusion Specialization		KEY:Kineticist ~ Infusion Specialization		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary								DESC:At 5th level, whenever a kineticist uses one or more infusions with a blast, she reduces the combined burn cost of the infusions by 1. This can't reduce the total cost of the infusions used below 0. She reduces the burn cost by 1 additional point at 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 20th levels.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Metakinesis				KEY:Kineticist ~ Metakinesis				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:At 5th level, a kineticist gains the ability to alter her kinetic blasts as if with metamagic feats by accepting burn. By accepting 1 point of burn, she can empower her kinetic blast (as if using Empower Spell). At 9th level, by accepting 2 points of burn, she can maximize her kinetic blast as if using Maximize Spell. At 13th level, by accepting 3 points of burn, she can quicken her kinetic blast as if using Quicken Spell. At 17th level, by accepting 4 points of burn, the kineticist can use her kinetic blast twice with the same standard action, or swift action if she also uses metakinesis to quicken the blast. When she uses a double kinetic blast, all modifications, such as metakinesis and infusions, apply to both of the blasts, but the kineticist needs to pay the burn cost only once.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Internal Buffer			KEY:Kineticist ~ Internal Buffer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:At 6th level, a kineticist's study of her body and the elemental forces that course through it allow her to form an internal buffer to store extra energy. The buffer starts empty and doesn't replenish each day, but the kineticist can accept 1 point of burn to add 1 point to the buffer as a full-round action, to a maximum of 1 point total. This maximum increases to 2 points at 11th level and to 3 points at 16th level. Once the kineticist adds points to her buffer, they remain indefinitely until she spends them. When she would otherwise accept burn, a kineticist can spend 1 point from her buffer to avoid accepting 1 point of burn. She cannot spend more than 1 point from her buffer in this way for a single wild talent. Points spent from the internal buffer don't activate elemental overf low or add to its effects. Similarly, this buffer can be used to exceed the limit on the number of points of burn the kineticist can accept in a single turn.																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Expanded Element			KEY:Kineticist ~ Expanded Element			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:At 7th level, a kineticist learns to use another element or expands her understanding of her own element. She can choose any element, including her primary element. She gains one of that element's simple blast wild talents that she does not already possess, if any. She also gains all composite blast wild talents whose prerequisites she meets, as well as the basic wild talent of her chosen expanded element (for instance, basic aerokinesis if she chooses air). See Composite Blasts on page 15 for additional rules for and descriptions of composite blasts. She doesn't gain the defense wild talent of the expanded element. If the kineticist's expanded element is different from her primary element, she treats her kineticist level as 4 levels lower for the purpose of determining which wild talents she can learn from her expanded element. If the kineticist chooses to expand her understanding of an element she already has, she gains an additional utility wild talent or infusion of her choice from that element, as if from her infusion or wild talent class feature, as appropriate. At 15th level, the kineticist can either select a new element or expand her understanding of her original element. She can't select the same element she selected at 7th level unless it is her primary element. She gains all the benefits from her new expanded element as listed above. However, if the kineticist selected her primary element as her expanded element at both 7th and 15th levels, her mastery of that element increases. For wild talents of her element, the kineticist gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls, as well as to caster level and DCs.																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Supercharge				KEY:Kineticist ~ Supercharge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:At 11th level, when using gather power as a move action, a kineticist can reduce the total burn cost of a single wild talent by 2 points instead of 1. When using gather power for 1 full round, she can reduce the burn cost of a single wild talent by 3 points instead of 2.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.14
Composite Specialization	KEY:Kineticist ~ Composite Specialization		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:At 16th level, a kineticist becomes more adept at creating composite blasts. She reduces the burn cost of all composite blasts by 1 point. This can't reduce the cost of a composite blast below 0 points.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.14
Metakinetic Master		KEY:Kineticist ~ Metakinetic Master			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:At 19th level, a kineticist chooses one type of metakinesis, such as empower or quicken. She reduces the burn cost of that metakinesis by 1 point (to a minimum of 0 points).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.14
Omnikinesis				KEY:Kineticist ~ Omnikinesis				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:At 20th level, a kineticist transcends the distinction between the different elements and can bend all creation to her will. By accepting 1 point of burn (in addition to any burn requirement of the kinetic blast she chooses), she can use any blast wild talent she doesn't know. By accepting 1 point of burn as a standard action, she can change any of her wild talents into any other wild talent of the same category (such as simple blasts or defense) for 24 hours, ignoring any elemental requirements or restrictions (but not any other requirements or restrictions).  #Medium																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.14

# Ability Name	Category of Ability		Description
Simple Blasts	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A kineticist gains a simple blast from her primary element at 1st level-some elements offer more than one option. When a kineticist gains a new element via the expanded element class feature, she gains a simple blast from that element as well. Each simple blast is either a physical blast or an energy blast. Physical blasts are ranged attacks that deal an amount of damage equal to 1d6+1 + the kineticist's Constitution modifier, increasing by 1d6+1 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st. Spell resistance doesn't apply against physical blasts. Energy blasts are ranged touch attacks that deal an amount of damage equal to 1d6 + 1/2 the kineticist's Constitution modifier, increasing by 1d6 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st.
Composite Blasts	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Composite blasts combine elements to form a new blast. When a kineticist gains a new element through expanded element, she gains access to all composite blasts for which she qualifies. Most composite blasts are either physical or energy blasts, like simple blasts. Physical composite blasts deal an amount of damage equal to 2d6+2 + the kineticist's Constitution modifier, increasing by 2d6+2 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st; energy composite blasts deal an amount of damage equal to 2d6 + 1/2 the kineticist's Constitution modifier, increasing by 2d6 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st.

The object must weigh no more than 5 pounds per kineticist level you possess. If the attack hits, the target and the thrown object each take the blast's damage. Since the object is enfolded in strands of aether, even if you use this power on a magic weapon or other unusual object, the attack doesn't use any of the magic weapon's bonuses or effects; it simply deals your blast damage. Alternatively, you can loosen the strands of aether in order to deal damage to both the object and the target as though you had thrown the object yourself (instead of dealing your normal blast damage). You substitute your Constitution modifier for your Strength modifier if throwing the object would have added your Strength modifier on the damage roll, and you don't take the -4 penalty on the attack roll for throwing an object that wasn't designed to be thrown. In this case, the object's special effects apply (including effects from its materials), and if the object is a weapon, you must be proficient with it and able to wield it with one hand; otherwise, the item deals damage as a one-handed improvised weapon for a creature of your size.

# Defense Wild Talents
ENVELOPING WINDS			KEY:Wild Talent ~ ENVELOPING WINDS			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Defense Wild Talent														DESC:&nl;Element air; Type defense (Su); Level -; Burn 0 You constantly surround yourself with a whirling torrent of air, crackling arcs of lightning, or both to protect yourself from ranged attacks. All ranged attacks made with physical weapons suffer a 20%% miss chance against you, except for attacks from massive weapons such as a giant's thrown boulder or a ballista. This ability has no effect on ray attacks. The miss chance increases by 5%% for every 5 kineticist levels you possess beyond 2nd. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can increase the miss chance by 5%% until the next time your burn is removed. You can continue to accept points of burn to increase the miss chance further, up to a maximum of 75%%. Whenever you accept burn while using an air wild talent, the energy surging through you causes your enveloping winds to also affect non-physical ranged attacks such as ray attacks for 1 round. You can dismiss or restore this effect as an immediate action.																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.16
FLESH OF STONE			KEY:Wild Talent ~ FLESH OF STONE			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Defense Wild Talent														DESC:&nl;Element earth; Type defense (Su); Level -; Burn 0 Your skin hardens like stone, dampening the impact of most attacks. You gain DR 1/adamantine. This DR increases by 1 for every 2 kineticist levels you possess beyond 2nd. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can increase the DR by 1 until the next time your burn is removed, to a maximum DR equal to your kineticist level. Whenever you accept burn while using an earth wild talent, the energy surging through you causes your damage reduction to change from DR/adamantine to DR/- for 1 round. You can dismiss and restore this effect as an immediate action.																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.17
FORCE WARD				KEY:Wild Talent ~ FORCE WARD				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Defense Wild Talent														DESC:&nl;Element aether; Type defense (Su); Level -; Burn 0 You constantly surround yourself with a ward of force. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your kineticist level. You always lose these temporary hit points first, even before other temporary hit points. If an attack deals less damage than you still have as temporary hit points from force ward, it still reduces those temporary hit points but otherwise counts as a miss for the purpose of abilities that trigger on a hit or a miss. These temporary hit points regenerate at a rate of 1 per minute. By accepting 1 point of burn as a standard action, you can increase the maximum number of temporary hit points provided by your force ward by half your kineticist level until the next time your burn is removed. If you use this ability multiple times, the increases stack. For every 2 points of burn you accept in this way, your force ward's rate of regeneration increases by 1 hit point per minute. Whenever you accept burn while using an aether wild talent, you siphon some of the energy from the aether flowing through you and your force ward recovers a number of temporary hit points equal to your character level, up to its current maximum. You can dismiss or restore your force ward as an immediate action, but doing so doesn't change the number of temporary hit points available, and the temporary hit points don't recover while this ability is inactive.																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.17
SEARING FLESH			KEY:Wild Talent ~ SEARING FLESH			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Defense Wild Talent														DESC:&nl;Element fire; Type defense (Su); Level -; Burn 0 Your body becomes painfully hot. Whenever a creature hits you with a natural attack or an unarmed strike, that creature takes 1 point of fire damage per 4 kineticist levels you possess (minimum 1 point of fire damage). A creature in a grapple with you takes double this amount of damage at the end of each of its turns. Weapons that strike you also take this damage, though the damage is unlikely to penetrate the weapon's hardness. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can increase this damage by 1 point per 4 kineticist levels you possess until the next time your burn is removed. You can increase the damage in this way up to seven times. Whenever you accept burn while using a fire wild talent, the surging flame causes your searing flesh to deal double its current amount of damage for 1 round (a creature in a grapple with you takes a total of four times as much damage as normal).

SHROUD OF WATER			KEY:Wild Talent ~ SHROUD OF WATER			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Defense Wild Talent														DESC:&nl;Element water; Type defense (Su); Level -; Burn 0 You surround yourself with a shroud of water, ice, or both that protects you from harm. The shroud can either cover your body, functioning as armor, or float around you and block attacks, functioning as a shield. It grants either a +4 armor bonus to AC or a +2 shield bonus to AC, and you can change the type of bonus as a standard action. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 kineticist levels you possess beyond 2nd. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can increase the bonus by 1 until the next time your burn is removed. You can increase the bonus multiple times in this way, but it can't be increased by more than 50%% of its starting value. When you change the shroud to grant a shield bonus, any bonus in excess of this limit doesn't apply, but it remains if you change the shroud's bonus type again. Whenever you accept burn while using a water wild talent, the water coalescing around you allows your shroud to grant both the armor bonus and the shield bonus for 1 round. You can dismiss or restore this effect as an immediate action.																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.17

Treat each square of the path of your ranged attack kinetic blast, the target square of your melee attack kinetic blast, or the area of your area of effect kinetic blast as the center of a continual flame effect that lasts until the end of your next turn. This effect counts as a 6th-level spell with the light descriptor.

BURNING INFUSION			KEY:Wild Talent ~ BURNING INFUSION			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Infusion Wild Talent														DESC:&nl;Element fire; Type substance infusion; Level 1; Burn 1 Associated Blasts blue flame, fire, magma, plasma Saving Throw Reflex negates Your kinetic blast ignites your foes. Whenever an infused blast hits a foe and penetrates its spell resistance, that foe catches on fire, regardless of whether it takes damage. A foe that catches fire takes 1d6 points of fire damage each round until the fire is extinguished. Against a creature on fire from this infusion, any fire kinetic blasts gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls, to DCs, and on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance.

CHAIN					KEY:Wild Talent ~ CHAIN					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Infusion Wild Talent														DESC:&nl;Element air; Type form infusion; Level 5; Burn 3 Associated Blasts electric Saving Throw none Your electric blast leaps from target to target. When you hit a target with your infused blast, you can attempt a ranged touch attack against an additional target that is within 30 feet of the first. Each additional attack originates from the previous target, which could alter cover and other conditions. Each additional target takes 1d6 fewer points of damage than the last (for example, 3d6 becomes 2d6), and you can't chain the blast back to a previous target. You can continue chaining your blasts until a blast misses or fails to deal damage, or until your blast is reduced to a single damage die.

You can center this 20-foot-radius spread anywhere within 120 feet of you. All creatures and objects within the cloud when you create it automatically take 1/4 the normal amount of damage from your blast with no saving throw. Any time a creature enters the cloud, it takes half the normal amount of damage from your blast, as do creatures that end their turns in the cloud. Your cloud obscures vision as obscuring mist. It lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier or until you use the cloud infusion again.

The ground roils and buckles beneath the affected area. All creatures and objects in contact with the ground within the area when you create it automatically take 1/4 of the normal damage from your blast with no saving throw. Any time a creature enters the area, it takes half the normal damage from your blast, as do creatures that end their turns in the area. The entire area counts as difficult terrain. This infusion lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier or until you use it again.

DISINTEGRATING INFUSION		KEY:Wild Talent ~ DISINTEGRATING INFUSION		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Infusion Wild Talent														DESC:&nl;Element aether; Type substance infusion; Level 6; Burn 4 Associated Blasts force Saving Throw Fortitude partial; see text You can use force to rip your targets apart. Against creatures, your kinetic blast deals double its normal amount of damage, but targets receive a saving throw to reduce the damage to half the blast's normal amount of damage (for a total of 1/4 of the blast's increased damage). Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by the blast is disintegrated, as the spell disintegrate. You can use the infused blast to destroy force effects or objects as disintegrate, but for each force effect or 10-foot cube of nonliving matter you destroy in this way, you must accept 1 point of burn, which can't be reduced by effects such as infusion specialization or gather power.																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.18
DRAINING INFUSION			KEY:Wild Talent ~ DRAINING INFUSION			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Infusion Wild Talent														DESC:&nl;Element universal; Type substance infusion; Level 1; Burn 1 Associated Blasts any simple Saving Throw Fortitude partial; see text You can drain elemental energy and matter from your foes to strengthen your next attack. When you use this infusion, your kinetic blast affects only creatures with a subtype matching your kinetic blast's element (for instance, a fire blast would damage only creatures of the fire subtype). Against such creatures, your blast targets touch AC (if it requires an attack roll) and always allows spell resistance. Because you are draining energy from the target, your blast doesn't apply your elemental overflow bonuses or Constitution modifier. The target can attempt a Fortitude save to take 1/4 the normal amount of damage. Draining infusion ignores any damage reduction, resistances, and immunities the creature might possess. If at least one creature fails its saving throw against your draining infusion, you can reduce the total burn cost of any one blast wild talent used before the end of your next turn by 1, or by 2 if you have the supercharge ability. If you use draining infusion again before applying this reduction, you still deal the damage from that draining infusion, but the burn reductions don't stack.

ENTANGLING INFUSION		KEY:Wild Talent ~ ENTANGLING INFUSION		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Infusion Wild Talent														DESC:&nl;Element earth or water; Type substance infusion; Level 2; Burn 2 Associated Blasts blizzard, cold, earth, ice, magma, metal, mud, sandstorm Saving Throw Reflex negates Your kinetic blast surrounds your foes in elemental matter. Whenever a blast with this infusion deals damage to a foe, that foe becomes entangled for 1 minute. The foe can remove this condition as a standard action with a successful Escape Artist or Strength check (with the same DC as for saves against your kinetic blast) or by dealing an amount of damage to the entangling matter equal to double your kineticist level (the matter has hardness 0). If the foe was already entangled by this infusion and fails its save against a second instance of this infusion, the increased amount of elemental matter fuses to the ground, causing the foe to be rooted in place as though anchored to an immobile object.

The pillar affects all creatures and objects in a 10-foot-radius cylinder that extends 40 feet above the ground. An energy blast infused with eruption deals its normal damage to each target, while a physical blast deals half its normal amount of damage. The saving throw DC is Dexterity-based.

FLASH INFUSION			KEY:Wild Talent ~ FLASH INFUSION			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Infusion Wild Talent														DESC:&nl;Element fire; Type substance infusion; Level 4; Burn 3 Associated Blasts blue flame, fire, plasma Saving Throw Will negates Your kinetic blast is so bright that it blinds your foes. Whenever an infused blast hits a foe and penetrates its spell resistance, that foe must succeed at a Will save or be blinded for 1 round, regardless of whether it takes damage from the blast. You can reduce the blast's damage by half to increase the DC of this save by 2.

FLURRY OF BLASTS			KEY:Wild Talent ~ FLURRY OF BLASTS			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Infusion Wild Talent	PRETEXT:Prerequisite extended range								DESC:Element universal; Type form infusion; Level 3; Burn 2	DESC:&nl;Associated Blasts any Saving Throw none Instead of a single kinetic blast, you shoot two kinetic blasts at targets within 120 feet that each deal damage as if your kineticist level were 1st (effects or abilities that increase your kinetic blast's damage don't apply). At 10th level, you can shoot three blasts with flurry of blasts; this increases to four blasts at 16th level and to five blasts at 20th level. If you are under the effect of haste or similar magic that increases your number of attacks in a fullattack action, the number of kinetic blasts in your flurry of blasts increases by 1. No two targets can be more than 30 feet apart. You must assign the targets of all your blasts before rolling any of the attacks. Any blast beyond the first that hits the same target adds 1d6 points of damage; bonuses and penalties to damage don't apply. If you are using a substance infusion that requires a saving throw, a target attempts its save only once (even if it was hit multiple times), but it takes a penalty on the save equal to the number of times it was hit beyond the first. If you are using a substance infusion that requires a caster level check or combat maneuver check, you roll the check only once against each target, but you gain a bonus on the check equal to the number of times that target was hit beyond the first. If you are using the pushing substance infusion, the maximum distance of the push increases by 5 feet for each time the target was hit beyond the first.															SOURCEPAGE:p.19
FOE THROW				KEY:Wild Talent ~ FOE THROW				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Infusion Wild Talent														DESC:&nl;Element aether; Type form infusion; Level 3; Burn 2 Associated Blasts telekinetic Saving Throw Fortitude negates; see text Your telekinetic blast can throw a Large or smaller creature instead of an unattended object; you can increase the burn cost by 1 to affect a creature of a larger size. If the creature you attempt to throw succeeds at a Fortitude save, it negates the blast entirely. Otherwise, if your blast hits, both the thrown creature and the target take the full amount of damage from your telekinetic blast, and the thrown creature falls prone in the last unoccupied space along its path. If your blast misses, the thrown creature can choose to occupy any space within 30 feet of the target, it doesn't fall prone, and it takes half the normal amount of damage from your blast. The movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.20
FORCE HOOK				KEY:Wild Talent ~ FORCE HOOK				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Infusion Wild Talent														DESC:&nl;Element aether; Type form infusion; Level 3; Burn 2 Associated Blasts force Saving Throw none Your force blast hooks onto its target and drags you adjacent to it.

Attempt a ranged attack roll against a target within 120 feet. If you hit, the target takes your kinetic blast damage with no saving throw. All other creatures and objects within a 20-foot burst take half the normal amount of damage and can attempt a Reflex save to reduce that damage by half again. If the attack misses its target, the blast has no effect. The saving throw DC is Dexterity-based.																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.20
GRAPPLING INFUSION		KEY:Wild Talent ~ GRAPPLING INFUSION		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Infusion Wild Talent														DESC:&nl;Element universal; Type substance infusion; Level 5; Burn 3 Associated Blasts any Saving Throw none Your cloud, deadly earth, or wall blast grows tendrils that hold your enemies in place. Whenever a creature takes damage from the infused blast, you can attempt a combat maneuver check to have the blast grapple that opponent. Your bonus on this check is equal to 2 + your kineticist level + your Constitution modifier (treat the blast as a Huge creature). The blast only grapples opponents; it can't perform other functions of grapple maneuvers such as pinning or moving the opponent. If the blast is already grappling an opponent, it receives a +5 bonus on its combat maneuver check to maintain the grapple, as normal. You can use this infusion only if you also use the cloud, deadly earth, or wall form infusion.																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.20
GUSTING INFUSION			KEY:Wild Talent ~ GUSTING INFUSION			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Infusion Wild Talent														DESC:&nl;Element air; Type substance infusion; Level 1; Burn 1 Associated Blasts air, blizzard, sandstorm, thunderstorm Saving Throw Fortitude negates The wind from your infusion causes your blast to act as an instantaneous gust of wind. If your blast has a clear path, you can accept 2 additional points of burn or reduce the damage to 0 in order to cause the gust of wind effect to persist for 1 round along that path.																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.20
IMPALE				KEY:Wild Talent ~ IMPALE				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Infusion Wild Talent														DESC:&nl;Element earth or water; Type form infusion; Level 3; Burn 2 Associated Blasts earth, ice, metal Saving Throw none You extend a long, sharp spike of elemental matter along a line, impaling multiple foes. Make a single attack roll against each creature or object in a 30-foot line, starting with the closest target. If the result is a critical threat, roll to confirm against only the first target you hit. Calculate damage against each target you hit, starting from the closest. If your attack hits a target but fails to deal physical damage to that target, the spike fails to penetrate and the infused blast doesn't continue. A blast with the impale infusion can penetrate solid barriers, but it must deal enough damage to destroy the barrier in order to continue through. Infused earth and metal blasts always deal piercing damage.																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.20
KINETIC BLADE			KEY:Wild Talent ~ KINETIC BLADE			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Infusion Wild Talent														DESC:&nl;Element universal; Type form infusion; Level 1; Burn 1 Associated Blasts any Saving Throw none You form a weapon using your kinetic abilities. You create a nonreach, light or one-handed weapon in your hand formed of pure energy or elemental matter. (If you're a telekineticist, you instead transfer the power of your kinetic blast to any object held in one hand.) The kinetic blade's shape is purely cosmetic and doesn't affect the damage dice, critical threat range, or critical multiplier of the kinetic blade, nor does it grant the kinetic blade any weapon special features. The object held by a telekineticist for this form infusion doesn't prevent her from using gather power. You can use this form infusion once as part of an attack action, a charge action, or a full-attack action in order to make melee attacks with your kinetic blade. Since it's part of another action (and isn't an action itself), using this wild talent doesn't provoke any additional attacks of opportunity. The kinetic blade deals your kinetic blast damage on each hit (applying any modifiers to your kinetic blast's damage as normal, but not your Strength modifier). The blade disappears at the end of your turn. The weapon deals the same damage type that your kinetic blast deals, and it interacts with Armor Class and spell resistance as normal for a blast of its type. Even if a telekineticist uses this power on a magic weapon or another unusual object, the attack doesn't use any of the magic weapon's bonuses or effects and simply deals the telekineticist's blast damage. The kinetic blade doesn't add the damage bonus from elemental overflow.	SOURCEPAGE:p.20
KINETIC FIST			KEY:Wild Talent ~ KINETIC FIST			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Infusion Wild Talent														DESC:&nl;Element universal; Type form infusion; Level 1; Burn 1 Associated Blasts any Saving Throw none You surround your body with energy or elemental matter from your kinetic abilities. You can use this form infusion as part of an attack action, a charge action, or a full-attack action to add damage to each of your natural attacks and unarmed strikes until the beginning of your next turn. Since kinetic fist is part of another action, using this wild talent doesn't provoke any additional attack of opportunity. You deal an additional 1d6 points of damage per 3 dice of your kinetic blast's damage (minimum 1d6), and this damage is of the same type as your kinetic blast's damage. This extra damage ignores spell resistance and doesn't apply any modifiers to your kinetic blast's damage, such as your Constitution modifier.

This functions as kinetic blade but counts as a reach weapon appropriate for your size. Unlike most reach weapons, the kinetic whip can also attack nearby creatures. The kinetic whip disappears at the beginning of your next turn, but in the intervening time, it threatens all squares within its reach, allowing you to make attacks of opportunity that deal the whip's usual damage.

Whenever an infused blast deals damage to a foe, attacks made with metal weapons (including metal kinetic blasts) against that foe receive a +4 bonus until the end of your next turn, and the foe takes a -4 penalty on Reflex saving throws to avoid metallic objects.

MOBILE BLAST			KEY:Wild Talent ~ MOBILE BLAST			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Infusion Wild Talent														DESC:&nl;Element universal; Type form infusion; Level 3; Burn 2 Associated Blasts any Saving Throw Reflex negates You send an elemental mass, energy ball, or object into a particular square within 30 feet, dealing 1/4 the normal amount of damage (or half the normal amount of damage, for an energy blast) to all creatures in that square. The mobile blast lasts until you dismiss it as a free action, lose consciousness, or move farther than 30 feet from it. Each round on your turn as a move action, you can move the mobile blast to another square within range; either way, it continues to deal damage to all creatures in its final square each round if they fail their saving throws. You can have only a single mobile blast in existence at a time. If the mobile blast's total burn cost before applying any reduction for gather power is 0, it has no maximum duration. Otherwise, it lasts for a maximum number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier, and afterward you can't create another mobile blast for a number of minutes equal to the number of rounds it existed. A mobile blast is always extremely loud and visible. The saving throw DC is Dexterity-based.																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.21

Attempt a bull rush combat maneuver check against each target damaged by your infused blast, using your Constitution modifier instead of your Strength modifier to determine your bonus. This infusion can push a foe back by a maximum of 5 feet. You can increase the burn cost of this infusion to increase the maximum distance pushed by 5 feet per additional point of burn accepted.

This allows you to use your windsight wild talent to catch a quick glimpse and hear a tiny snippet from any location that could be reached by the wind traveling that distance (the wind's path can't pass through openings smaller than 1 inch in diameter). The breeze travels 100 feet per round, so what you see and hear is delayed by 1 round for every 50 feet of the path. If you spend at least 10 minutes to set up a steady flow of wind, you can concentrate for up to 1 minute per level to gain continuous visual and auditory information for as long as you concentrate, delayed by 1 round for every 100 feet the wind travels (since the steady flow of wind has to travel only one way).

Spirit				KEY:Medium ~ Spirit				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																													DESC:A medium serves as a vessel to channel spirits-astral echoes of powerful souls from ages past that live on in myth and legend. Each day, a medium can channel a spirit through a ritual known as a seance. Seances take 1 hour to perform and require the medium's concentration. At the end of a seance, the medium invites a local spirit to inhabit him and serve as his spirit for that day. Each spirit arises from one of six legends. Though the medium can choose the legend to which the spirit he channels belongs, he must channel that spirit from an appropriate location. Each spirit has a favored location it usually inhabits, though spirits may also be present at other locations appropriate to their legends. The medium gains the spirit's listed seance boon and lesser spirit power for 24 hours. 	DESC:The medium also gains the spirit's intermediate spirit power|PREVARGTEQ:MediumLVL,6	DESC:, its greater spirit power|PREVARGTEQ:MediumLVL,11	DESC:, and its supreme spirit power|PREVARGTEQ:MediumLVL,17	DESC:. After 24 hours, the medium loses contact with the channeled spirit and can perform another seance.&nl; A medium can invite his allies to participate in his seance-shared seance and certain spirit powers affect other participants. A character counts as participating so long as she maintains physical contact with another participating character and willfully opens herself to the spirit; unlike the medium, other participating characters can take other actions during this time. Only creatures with an Intelligence score of at least 3 can participate in a seance.&nl; In addition to granting power to the medium, a channeled spirit can influence the medium. By channeling a spirit, the medium allows the spirit to gain 1 point of influence over him. If the medium loses that 1 point of influence, he loses contact with the spirit, though he is still unable to perform a new seance until the normal 24 hour period has elapsed since his last seance. When the spirit leaves after the 24-hour duration and before the next seance, the spirit's influence over the medium resets to 0. Certain abilities allow the medium to gain additional power in exchange for allowing the spirit more influence over him.&nl; When a spirit gains at least 3 points of influence over the medium, the dual impulses housed within the same body cause the medium to meld with his spirit's consciousness. The resulting muddled sense of self and struggle for control causes the medium to take a -2 penalty on initiative checks as well as a specific additional penalty. However, the spirit's mental presence grants the medium a +4 bonus against possession effects and a +2 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects that are not related to possession.&nl; If a spirit ever attains 5 or more points of influence over the medium, the medium completely loses control to the spirit. He effectively becomes an NPC under the GM's control until after he awakens the next day with the spirit gone.&nl; During his seance, the medium can choose to channel a weaker spirit to gain its help without incurring as much of its influence. If he does so, he can forgo any number of spirit powers, starting with his most powerful spirit power. For each spirit power he forgoes, the medium can use his spirit surge ability twice without incurring influence.	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Medium Spirit Choice|1	SOURCEPAGE:p.30
Spirit Surge			KEY:Medium ~ Spirit Surge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DEFINE:SpiritSurgeDice|0																					DESC:After failing a d20 roll that was modified by his spirit bonus, a medium can allow his spirit to gain 1 additional point of influence over him in order to add 1d%1 to the check's result without taking an action. This can cause the check to succeed instead of fail.

Shared Seance			KEY:Medium ~ Shared Seance			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																													DESC:A medium can share his channeled spirit's aid with his allies.

SOURCEPAGE:p.31
Taboo					KEY:Medium ~ Taboo				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																													DESC:During his daily seance, a medium can accept a taboo in order to appease his spirit. Each spirit lists example taboos, and the GM may allow additional taboos as well. Accepting a taboo allows the medium to use his spirit surge ability twice without incurring influence. The medium can select only a single taboo. The medium is not magically prevented from breaking his taboo, but if he breaks the taboo for any reason, he takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws for 1 hour and his spirit gains 1 point of influence over him. If the medium continues violating the taboo while taking the penalty, the duration of the penalty extends, but the spirit doesn't gain additional influence over the medium. If a spirit attains 5 points of influence because of a violated taboo, instead of possessing the medium, the spirit leaves the medium's body entirely, and the medium loses access to his spirit powers, spirit bonus, and spirit surge abilities until the next time he can perform a seance. Banishing a spirit in this way damages the medium's connection to that spirit's legend; the medium cannot channel spirits of that legend for 1 week, and the next time the medium channels a spirit of that legend, it starts with 2 points of influence over him instead of 1.

Haunt Channeler			KEY:Medium ~ Haunt Channeler			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DEFINE:HauntChannelDice|0	DEFINE:HauntChannelDC|0																	DESC:A medium can use his familiarity with spirits to assist him when dealing with haunts. He can always act on the surprise round against a haunt, and his touch funnels a portion of the haunt into himself, dealing %1d6 points of damage to the haunt as if via positive energy and allowing the medium to ask the haunt a single question. The haunt can answer the question however it chooses. Additionally, the medium can forgo his saving throw against a haunt's effects to funnel the haunt entirely into himself. If he does so, the medium suffers the haunt's full effect, but the haunt doesn't affect anyone else (even if it normally would). The haunt then gains control of the medium's body for 24 hours. Once per minute, the medium can attempt to end this possession early by succeeding at a Will save (DC %2).|HauntChannelDice|HauntChannelDC													BONUS:VAR|HauntChannelDice|MediumLVL/2	BONUS:VAR|HauntChannelDC|20+MediumLVL/2																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.31

The effects are similar to the spell call spirit, except that the duration is %1 round(s) and the spirit possesses the medium's body instead of appearing in a wispy form. The other participants of the seance must ask the questions. Once the medium attempts to call a spirit, he cannot attempt to call the same spirit again for 24 hours. Once per round, the medium can attempt to end the seance early by succeeding at a Will save (DC %2).|LocationChannelDuration|LocationChannelDC																																				BONUS:VAR|LocationChannelDuration|MediumLVL	BONUS:VAR|LocationChannelDC|20+MediumLVL/2																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.32	SPELLS:Medium|TIMES=ATWILL|CASTERLEVEL=MediumLVL|Call Spirit,13+CHA

That creature takes a -%1 penalty on Will saving throws. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target's mind; the creature doesn't remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist's focus than the target's perception of his stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists' stares don't stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches' evil eye hexes.

Each day, he can implant %1 of these tricks. He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).&nl; To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick's description), even if it isn't his turn. The subject must be within medium range (%2 feet) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick.

A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of %1 to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn't detect the mesmerist's lies or force him to speak only the truth.

# Ability Name		Unique Key							Category of Ability		Type						Description																																																																																																																																																																																																																															Source Page
Astounding Avoidance	KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Astounding Avoidance	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:The subject can avoid damage from magical and unusual attacks. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a saving throw against an attack or spell that normally deals half damage on a successful save, before the subject rolls the save. If the subject succeeds at her save, she takes no damage.	DESC:The subject takes only half damage is she fails her save. |PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,12	DESC:The benefits of this trick don't stack with those of the evasion or stalwart class features.																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Compel Alacrity		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Compel Alacrity		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A dash of mental speed lets the subject push past her physical limits to avoid an enemy. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject begins her turn within an enemy's reach. The subject can move %1 feet as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. The subject can't move farther than her speed in this way. The movement from this trick doesn't count against the subject's movement speed for that round.|10+5*floor(MesmeristLVL/5)																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.40
False Flanker		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ False Flanker			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A duplicate of the mesmerist appears momentarily, as though he were fighting in tandem with the subject. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject moves into or begins her turn in a square where she threatens an enemy. An illusory duplicate of the mesmerist appears in any unoccupied space adjacent to that enemy. This duplicate counts as threatening the enemy for the purposes of determining flanking, but can't actually make attacks. The duplicate disappears at the end of the turn during which the trick is triggered. This is an illusion (figment) effect, and a creature that interacts with the false flanker can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect.																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Fearsome Guise		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Fearsome Guise		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A veil of illusion makes the subject appear to be someone else and then transform into a hideous monster at an opportune time. While this trick is implanted, the subject's appearance is altered, as disguise self. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attacks a creature. The illusory appearance briefly makes the subject appear monstrous, then ends. The mesmerist attempts an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of the triggering attack. The restrictions on attempts to demoralize a target (the target being within 30 feet and able to see and hear the creature attempting the Intimidate check) apply to the subject of the trick. This is an illusion (glamer) effect.																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Gift of Will		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Gift of Will			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A small portion of the mesmerist's vast mental power buttresses his ally's mind. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a Will saving throw or a Sense Motive check, or is targeted by an Intimidate check to demoralize her. For a saving throw, the subject uses the mesmerist's Will saving throw bonus instead of her own. For a Sense Motive check or Intimidate check, she adds the mesmerist's Charisma bonus as a morale bonus on the check or to the DC. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Levitation Buffer		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Levitation Buffer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A mesmerist's telekinetic assault renders foes around the subject less of a threat. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when either an enemy moves adjacent to the subject or the subject begins her turn with one or more enemies adjacent to her. The mesmerist can either lift all enemies adjacent to the subject slightly into the air or push them all away from the subject. Lifting enemies causes them to move at half speed and take a -4 penalty to their CMDs against bull rush, drag, and reposition attempts for 1 round (Will negates). The speed reduction and CMD penalty don't stack with those from hostile levitation. Pushing enemies away requires the mesmerist to attempt a bull rush combat maneuver check using %1 as his CMB. Any enemy that's successfully pushed moves away from the subject of the trick using the normal rules for a bull rush.|MesmeristLVL+CHA																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Linked Reaction		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Linked Reaction		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A hive mind allows the mesmerist and an ally to share one another's reaction times. The mesmerist can trigger this trick whe either the subject or the mesmerist is surprise and the other isn't (even if the mesmerist would normally be unable to take actions because of being surprised). Both the mesmerist and the subject can act in this surprise round. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Mask Misery			KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Mask Misery			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:The subject can shrug off a condition for a short time before succumbing to it. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject becomes affected by a minor	DESC:or moderate|PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,6	DESC: condition listed under the touch treatment ability. The subject can ignore the effect of	DESC:that|PREVARLT:MesmeristLVL,6	DESC:a moderate|PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,6	DESC: condition for 1d4 rounds, after which the subject takes the full effect. This has no effect on any conditions affecting the subject other than the triggering condition, even if those other effects are also listed under touch treatment. The rounds during which the subject ignores the triggering effect still count against that effect's duration; if the duration of mask misery is longer than the effect lasts, the subject isn't affected by the condition at all. If an effect that imposes more than one condition triggers this trick, the subject ignores all eligible conditions.	DESC:This trick ends minor conditions entirely instead of suppressing them temporarily. |PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,6	DESC:The mesmerist doesn't need to have touch treatment to choose or use this trick.																											SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Meek Facade			KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Meek Facade			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:The subject magically seems like a weak target, goading an enemy into attacking her. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject misses a creature with an attack (even if it's part of a full attack in which she hits that creature with another attack). The enemy must attack no one other than the subject, and the subject gains a +%1 dodge bonus to AC against the triggering enemy's attacks. Both of these effects last for 1 round. This is mind-affecting compulsion effect.|2+MesmeristLVL/5																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Mesmeric Mirror		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Mesmeric Mirror		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:An illusory image appears near the subject to throw off attackers. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is attacked or becomes the target of a spell that requires an attack roll. %1 duplicate(s) of the subject appears, and the attacker must determine randomly which it hits (as mirror image). Each image lasts for %2 minute(s) or until destroyed. This is an illusion (figment) effect.|min(1+MesmeristLVL/5,5)|MesmeristLVL																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Mesmeric Pantomine	KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Mesmeric Pantomine		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:By orchestrating the movement of his ally's body, the mesmerist imparts to that ally his own skill at a physical task. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a Strength- or Dexterity-based skill check. The subject either uses the mesmerist's bonus on the skill check in place of her own or gains a +%1 morale bonus on the check, whichever results in a higher modifier. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.|CHA																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Misdirection		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Misdirection			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:An enemy's perception of an attack by the subject shifts, making the foe unprepared to defend against the attack. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject makes an attack or uses a spell that requires an attack roll. The mesmerist attempts a Bluff check to feint against a single target of the subject's attack. Unlike a normal feint, this ability can be used on non-melee attacks. If the feint succeeds, the target of the attack is denied its Dex bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The target doesn't suffer any additional effects that the mesmerist or the subject would cause on a normal feint or Bluff check. This is an illusion (glamer) effect.																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Psychosomatic Surge	KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Psychosomatic Surge		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:Psychic magic soothes the subject, alleviating her wounds temporarily. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage. The subject gains 1d8	DESC:+%1|MesmeristLVL/2|PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,2	DESC: temporary hit points. If the damage from the triggering attack would have reduced the subject to 0 hit points or fewer, this trick grants an additional 1d8 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour or until discharged.																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Reflection of Weakness	KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Reflection of Weakness	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:Psychic feedback causes an enemy to suffer from the same weakening effect it imposes on the subject. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when an attack or spell used by an enemy causes the subject to take ability damage, ability drain, bleed damage, or a minor or moderate condition listed under the touch treatment class feature. If the trick is triggered by ability damage, ability drain, or bleed damage, the amount of damage or drain the subject takes is reduced by 2 points (to a minimum of 0 points), and the creature that made the attack or cast the spell takes 2 points of ability damage to an ability score of the mesmerist's choice. The monster can attempt a Will save to negate the ability damage. This ability can be used if the attacker inflicts a curse, disease, or poison that deals ability damage or drain, but only if it deals that damage immediately, with no onset time. If the trick is triggered by the subject gaining a condition, the subject is still affected by the condition, but the attacker takes a condition of the mesmerist's choice for 1 round. This condition must come from the minor condition or moderate condition lists of the touch treatment class feature. The enemy can attempt a Will save to avoid gaining the condition. The mesmerist doesn't need to have touch treatment to select or use this trick.	SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Shadow Splinter		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Shadow Splinter		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:The mesmerist protects the subject against an attack and redirects the harm to someone else. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage from an attack. The damage the subject takes is reduced by %1 (to a maximum of the total amount of damage the attack deals). Another creature within range of the original attack, other than the attacker, is affected by a shadow illusion that makes it appear as if the attacker is attacking that creature instead of the attacker's actual target. This second creature takes an amount of damage equal to the amount by which the attack's damage was reduced. This shadow doesn't require a roll to hit and ignores cover and concealment, but the target can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. If it succeeds at this save, it neither takes the damage nor believes the attacker targeted it. This trick can't be triggered if there's no eligible second creature within range to take the redirected damage. This is an illusion (shadow) effect.|3+CHA																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.42
Spectral Smoke		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Spectral Smoke		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A cloud of smoke pops up around the subject, foiling attacks. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is attacked by an attack or by a spell that requires an attack roll. A smoke cloud appears in the subject's square and in a %1-foot radius around it. This cloud lasts for %2 round(s). The cloud functions as fog cloud, but is an illusion (figment) effect that can't be dispersed by wind and can be used underwater. A creature that interacts with the cloud can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect.|min(10+5*floor(MesmeristLVL/5),30)|MesmeristLVL																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.42
Vanish Arrow		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Vanish Arrow			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:With a flourish, the mesmerist snatches a projectile from an enemy before it can be shot. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by a ranged weapon attack, before the attack roll is made. The mesmerist attempts a Sleight of Hand check opposed by the attacker's Perception check. If the mesmerist succeeds, that ranged attack automatically misses, and the projectile appears stowed on the mesmerist's person. If the attacker is making a full attack, this affects only one of the attacks (of the mesmerist's choice). If the attack is made with a javelin or other thrown weapon, the attacker gains a +4 bonus on its Perception check. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as boulders or ballista bolts) and ranged attacks generated by natural attacks or spell effects are not affected by this ability.

Psychic Inception	KEY:Bold Stare ~ Psychic Inception	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoldStare.SpecialQuality	DESC:The hypnotic stare and its penalty can affect creatures that are mindless or immune to mind-affecting effects (such as an undead or vermin). The mesmerist can also partially affect such a creature with his mind-affecting spells and abilities if it's under the effect of his hypnotic stare; it gains a +2 bonus on its saving throw (if any), and if affected, it still has a 50%% chance each round of ignoring the effect.

Mental Fallback			KEY:Masterful Trick ~ Mental Fallback		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mesmerist ~ Masterful Tricks						DESC:Mental commands placed deep in the subject's mind trigger when she would fall under mind control, allowing the mesmerist to control her instead. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is affected by a charm or compulsion effect created by an enemy. The subject acts as thought the mesmerist had cast the spell instead of the enemy. For instance, if the subject were affected by charm monster cast by an enemy, that enemy can't try to give her orders, but the mesmerist could. If the charm or compulsion causes penalties or conditions (such as those imposed by confusion, crushing despair, or hold person), the subject can ignore any of those penalties or conditions the mesmerist chooses. This trick overrides the charm or compulsion for %1 rounds or until the duration of the triggering effect elapses, whichever comes first. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.

Spatial Switch			KEY:Masterful Trick ~ Spatial Switch		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mesmerist ~ Masterful Tricks						DESC:The mesmerist allows himself and an ally to physically swap places. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when an enemy moves adjacent to or attacks either the subject or the mesmerist, provided the subject and the mesmerist are within 100 feet of one another. The subject and the mesmerist then swap positions. If this trick was triggered by an attack, the swap happens before checking to see whether the attack hits. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself. This is a conjuration (teleportation) effect.

Spell Anticipation		KEY:Masterful Trick ~ Spell Anticipation		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mesmerist ~ Masterful Tricks						DESC:The mesmerist can choose a spell to strike back at enemy spellcasters. When the mesmerist implants this trick, he must expend expend one spell slot to couple a spell he knows of that level with the trick. That spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less and be able to target one creature (spells like dominate person that have more restrictive targeting can be used, but have no effect if triggered against creatures that don't match). He can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by an enemy's spell. The mesmerist's spell then triggers, affecting only the enemy spellcaster. This takes effect only if the enemy spellcaster is within range of the spell (as measured from the subject of the trick), and functions as though the mesmerist were in the subject's square. The enemy's spell still has its full effect, even if the mesmerist's spell would normally protect against it or make the caster unable to cast it.

The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject hits with an attack using a weapon, a natural weapon, or an unarmed strike. The attack's target must succeed at a Will saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. If the triggering attack was a critical hit, the target doesn't get a saving throw.

# Occultist
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Occultist ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality																				DESC:An occultist is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.46
Spells				KEY:Occultist ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality																				DESC:An occultist casts psychic spells drawn from the occultist spell list presented on page 58, limited by the implement groups he knows. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every occultist spell has an implement component (see Implements on page 47). To learn or cast a spell, an occultist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an occultist's spell equals 10 + the spell level + the occultist's Intelligence modifier. An occultist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Occultist. In addition, he gains bonus spells per day if he has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1-3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). The occultist's selection of spells is limited. For each implement school he learns to use, he can add one spell of each level he can cast to his list of spells known, chosen from that school's spell list. If he selects the same implement school multiple times, he adds one spell of each level from that school's list for each time he has selected that school. When the occultist learns to cast a new level of spells, he immediately adds one spell of that level to his list of spells known from each implement school he knows (plus any extra spells from schools he has selected multiple times). At 5th level and every 3 occultist levels thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), an occultist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the occultist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level occultist spell the occultist can cast. The spell learned must come from the same list of spells provided by the implement school of the spell lost. An occultist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for that level. An occultist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.46
Focus Powers			KEY:Occultist ~ Focus Powers				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:At 1st level, an occultist learns the base focus power from both of his two implement schools (see Implements below) and can select one more focus power from the list of those available to him through those schools. Whenever the occultist learns a new implement school, he gains the base power of that school. In addition, at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, he learns a new focus power selected from the options granted by all of the implement schools he knows. The occultist can use focus powers only by expending mental focus (see Mental Focus on page 48). Unless otherwise noted, the DC for any saving throw against a focus power equals 10 + 1/2 the occultist's level + the occultist's Intelligence modifier. The occultist can't select a focus power more than once. Some focus powers require him to reach a specific occultist level before he can choose them.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.47
Implements				KEY:Occultist ~ Implements				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:At 1st level, an occultist learns to use two implement schools. At 2nd level and every 4 occultist levels thereafter, the occultist learns to use one additional implement school, to a maximum of seven schools at 18th level. Each implement school adds one spell per spell level of that school of magic to the occultist's spell list. No spells from any other school are considered to be on the occultist's spell list until he selects the associated implement school. He can't use spell trigger or spell completion magic items from unknown schools without succeeding at the appropriate Use Magic Device check. An occultist can select an implement school more than once in order to learn additional spells from the associated school. Each implement school is represented by a small list of objects. Every day, the occultist selects one item from that school's list to be his implement for the day for each implement school he knows. The occultist needs only one such item to cast spells of the corresponding school, unless he selected that implement school multiple times, in which case he needs one item for each set of spells gained from that school. Implements don't need to be magic items, and nonmagical implements don't take up a magic item slot even if they're worn. Implements that are not magic items are often of some historical value or of personal significance to the occultist, such as the finger bone of a saint, the broken scepter of a long-dead king, the skull of a mentor's familiar, or the glass eye of an uncanny ancestor. Whenever an occultist casts a spell, he must have the corresponding implement in his possession and present the implement to the target or toward the area of effect. This act is part of casting the spell and doesn't require any additional action. If the occultist lacks the corresponding implement, he can attempt to cast the spell, but must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + the spell's level) to do so. Spells cast by an occultist without the appropriate implement are always treated as if they were cast at the minimum caster level for the spell in question (caster level 1st for a 1st-level spell, caster level 4th for a 2nd-level spell, and so on). Each implement school also grants a base focus power. This power is added to the list of focus powers possessed by the occultist (see Mental Focus below). In addition, each implement school grants access to a number of other focus powers that the occultist can select from using his mental focus class feature. See the Implement Schools section starting on page 50 for a complete list of implements associated with each school and their focus powers.						SOURCEPAGE:p.47
Knacks				KEY:Occultist ~ Knacks					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality																				DESC:An occultist learns one knack, or 0-level psychic spell, each time he selects an implement school (including when he again selects a school that he has already learned to use). These spells are cast like any other spell, but they can be cast any number of times per day. Knacks cast using any other spell slots because of metamagic feats applied to them, for example, consume spell slots as normal.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.48
Mental Focus			KEY:Occultist ~ Mental Focus				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:An occultist can invest a portion of his mental focus into his chosen implements for the day, allowing him to utilize a variety of abilities depending on the implements and the amount of mental focus invested in them. An occultist has a number of points of mental focus equal to his occultist level + his Intelligence modifier; these points refresh each day. He can divide this mental focus between his implements in any way he desires. If an implement is lost or destroyed, the focus invested in it is lost as well, though the occultist still refreshes those points of focus normally. Once mental focus is invested inside an implement, the implement gains the resonant power of its implement school (see page 50), and the occultist can expend the mental focus stored in the implement to activate the associated focus powers he knows. If a resonant power grants a bonus that varies based on the amount of mental focus invested in the implement, the bonus is determined when the focus is invested, and is not reduced or altered by expending the mental focus invested in the item. Once all of the mental focus in an implement has been expended, it loses its resonant power until mental focus is once again invested in the implement. The implement grants its resonant power to whoever possesses it; the occultist can lend the implement to an ally to assist that ally, but if he does so, he has difficulty casting that implement's spells (see Implements on page 47) and can't expend that implement's focus on focus powers until he retrieves the implement or refreshes his focus. The occultist refreshes his mental focus once each day after receiving at least 8 hours of sleep. After refreshing his mental focus, the occultist must spend 1 hour preparing his implements and investing them with this power. Mental focus that is not used before the next time the occultist refreshes his focus is lost. The occultist can choose to save generic mental focus inside his own body instead of investing all of it, but expending this focus comes at a higher cost. Any focus power the occultist activates with generic focus costs twice as much mental focus to use (and to maintain, if applicable). The occultist can expend his generic focus through an appropriate implement on any focus power he knows, but an implement he didn't invest any focus in at the start of the day grants no resonant power.																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.48
Magic Item Skill			KEY:Occultist ~ Magic Item Skill			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																		DESC:At 2nd level, an occultist's knowledge of magic items grants him a bonus when attempting to use them. He gains a bonus on all Use Magic Device checks equal to 1/2 his occultist level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.48
Object Reading			KEY:Occultist ~ Object Reading			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:At 2nd level, an occultist learns how to read information from items he examines. Examining an item in this way requires him to spend 1 minute handling the item. If the item is a magic item, the occultist learns its properties and command word as if he had successfully examined the item using detect magic and succeeded at a Spellcraft check. This ability does not reveal whether the item is cursed unless the occultist's class level is equal to or greater than the caster level of the item. If the item has any historical significance, the occultist learns one piece of information about its past (as determined by the GM). Finally, if the item was last used no longer than 1 day ago per the occultist's class level, the occultist learns one piece of information about the last creature to use the item. This information might be a glimpse of the creature's appearance, a brief vision of what it saw while using the item, or perhaps its emotional state when it last used the item. The GM determines what information is gained in this way. This functions like the psychometry occult skill unlock (see page 196), but doesn't require a skill check and can be used at will.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.48
Shift Focus				KEY:Occultist ~ Shift Focus				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:At 4th level, an occultist gains the ability to shift his mental focus from one implement to another, though some of the focus is lost along the way. Shifting mental focus removes a number of points of mental focus from one implement and adds the same number - 1 to another implement; this takes 1 minute of quiet contemplation while touching both implements. The occultist can shift his mental focus only from one implement to another implement; he can't shift generic focus into an implement. Unlike expending focus normally, this shift can reduce the effect of a resonant power in the implement from which the mental focus was taken. It does not, however, add to the resonant power of the implement to which the focus is added.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.48
Aura Sight				KEY:Occultist ~ Aura Sight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:At 5th level, the occultist can read the auras of creatures around him as a standard action. This functions as the aura sightACG spell with a duration of 1 round.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.49
Magic Circles			KEY:Occultist ~ Magic Circles				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:At 8th level, an occultist learns how to draw magic circles. To draw a circle, he must have chalk, salt, blood, powdered silver, or some other appropriate substance at hand (although he can press a magic circle into a softer surface such as dirt or clay). Drawing a circle takes 1 minute and requires the occultist to expend 1 point of mental focus (either generic focus or focus from any one of his implements). Once completed, this circle functions as a permanent magic circle against any alignment of the occultist's choosing. The circle can't be against a component of the occultist's alignment (if he is lawful good, for example, it can't be a magic circle against good or law). The circle remains until its form is physically broken (for example, if the lines are smeared or the salt is scattered). Only a living creature can break the circle; environmental effects can't break it. An occultist can have only one circle created in this way at a time. If he creates a second circle, the first one loses all its magic powers. This type of magic circle can't normally be focused inward to bind an outsider.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.49
Outside Contact			KEY:Occultist ~ Outside Contact			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:At 8th level, the occultist learns the true name of one particular outsider. This outsider can have no more than 3 Hit Dice. Whenever the occultist creates a magic circle, he can expend 1 additional point of mental focus to focus the circle inward and lure that outsider to the circle (similar to using lesser planar binding). The outsider is bound for up to 10 minutes. During this time, the occultist can bargain with the outsider for one piece of information. This requires a payment of at least 20 gp (or items of at least that value that are of interest to the outsider). The bargaining requires the occultist to attempt a Diplomacy or Intimidate check opposed by the outsider's Sense Motive check. Succeeding at the check by 5 or more reduces this cost to 10 gp. Failure increases the price to 30 gp, whereas failure by 5 or more allows the outsider to escape without giving any information (or receiving payment). The information gained can be anything that might be learned through a divination spell. The information is always correct but is frequently cryptic. It typically takes the outsider 1d3 hours to gather the information, at which point it returns of its own accord to deliver the information as promised. The outsider always resents being used in this way, even if the occultist and the outsider share an alignment component. After the occultist bargains with the outsider, the magic circle loses all power and the outsider is sent back to its home plane. At 12th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the occultist learns to contact one additional outsider of the same type or a different type. Although he can call only one outsider in this way at a time, the occultist can ask such an outsider one additional question per calling for every 4 occultist levels he possesses beyond 8th (to a maximum of four questions at 20th level), all for the same bargaining price. The questions must be in some way related to one another. At 16th level, in lieu of asking questions, the occultist can demand that the outsider deliver a message to any one friendly creature that the occultist knows personally. The occultist can also task the outsider to deliver one object weighing no more than 1 pound. Either of these demands requires an opposed check as described above. Delivery typically takes 1d4 hours, but this period is reduced to 1d6 minutes if the recipient is within 1 mile of the occultist (or even less if the recipient is within sight). The occultist must be able to accurately describe the recipient in both name and appearance. This ability can't be used to deliver anything to a location, or to enemies or creatures that are unfriendly to the occultist.	SOURCEPAGE:p.49
Binding Circles			KEY:Occultist ~ Binding Circles			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:At 12th level, whenever the occultist creates a magic circle he can expend 1 additional point of mental focus to make it a binding circle. A binding circle is invisible and counts as a trap. If a living creature of the corresponding alignment steps inside it, the trap triggers and binds the creature inside the circle. While it can move freely within the circle, it can't leave the circle, make attacks against targets outside the circle, cast spells that cross the circle's boundary (the circle blocks line of effect from the inside), or use any ability that would allow it to leave the circle or disturb the circle in any way. When the circle traps a creature in this way, the creature can attempt a Ref lex save to dive out of the circle before the magic takes hold (DC = 10 + 1/2 the occultist's level + the occultist's Intelligence modifier). A creature that can see the circle gains a +4 bonus on this save. If it fails its save, the creature must remain in the circle, although it can attempt a Will save at the same DC at the end of each hour of imprisonment to escape. A binding circle can be spotted with a successful Perception check (DC = 25 + 1/2 the occultist's level). It can also be disarmed using Disable Device, with the same DC. Anything crossing the boundary of the circle from the outside, such as a weapon, spell effect, or special ability, immediately breaks the circle and frees the creature trapped inside.																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.49
Fast Circles			KEY:Occultist ~ Fast Circles				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:At 16th level, the occultist learns to draw magic circles very quickly. He can draw a magic circle as a full-round action, but any circle drawn in this way has a duration of 1 minute per occultist level (unless it's drawn in conjunction with the outside contact class feature, in which case it lasts for 10 minutes as normal). If he draws a binding circle in this way, its duration is 1 round per occultist level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.49
Implement Mastery			KEY:Occultist ~ Implement Mastery			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:At 20th level, an occultist learns to master one of his implements. He selects one implement school. Whenever he uses a focus power from an implement of that school, the DC to resist any of the effects increases by 4 and he treats his occultist level as 4 higher when determining the effects and duration of that power. In addition, the occultist gains 4 extra points of mental focus, but these points must always be invested in implements of the mastered school. He can't save these points or expend them for any ability other than the focus powers of those implements. The hardness of each of the occultist's implements of the mastered school increases by an additional 20 as long as the item has at least 1 point of mental focus stored within.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Psychic ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:A psychic is proficient with all simple weapons, but not with any type of armor or shield.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.60
Spells				KEY:Psychic ~ Spells						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:A psychic casts psychic spells drawn from the psychic class's spell list (see page 69). She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a psychic must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a psychic's spell is equal to 10 + the spell's level + the psychic's Intelligence modifier. A psychic can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-7: Psychic. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1-3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). The psychic's selection of spells is limited. A psychic begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the psychic's choice. At each new psychic level, she learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-8: Psychic Spells Known. Unlike a psychic's spells per day, the number of spells a psychic knows isn't affected by her Intelligence score; the numbers on Table 1-8 are fixed. At 4th level and every even-numbered level thereafter (6th, 8th, and so on), a psychic can choose to learn a single new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the psychic loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell from the psychic's class list that the psychic can cast. A psychic can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. A psychic need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any psychic spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.	SOURCEPAGE:p.60
Knacks				KEY:Psychic ~ Knacks						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:Psychics learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-8. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they don't consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots (due to metamagic feats, for example) consume spell slots as normal.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.60
Phrenic Pool			KEY:Psychic ~ Phrenic Pool					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A psychic has a pool of supernatural mental energy that she can draw upon to manipulate psychic spells as she casts them. The maximum number of points in a psychic's phrenic pool is equal to 1/2 her psychic level + her Wisdom or Charisma modifier, as determined by her psychic discipline. The phrenic pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours don't need to be consecutive. The psychic might be able to recharge points in her phrenic pool in additional circumstances dictated by her psychic discipline. Points gained in excess of the pool's maximum are lost.																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.60
Phrenic Amplifications		KEY:Psychic ~ Phrenic Amplifications			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:A psychic develops particular techniques to empower her spellcasting, called phrenic amplif ications. The psychic can activate a phrenic amplification only while casting a spell using psychic magic, and the amplification modifies either the spell's effects or the process of casting it. The spell being cast is called the linked spell. The psychic can activate only one amplification each time she casts a spell, and doing so is part of the action used to cast the spell. She can use any amplification she knows with any psychic spell, unless the amplification's description states that it can be linked only to certain types of spells. A psychic learns one phrenic amplification at 1st level, selected from the list below. At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, the psychic learns a new phrenic amplification. A phrenic amplification can't be selected more than once. Once a phrenic amplification has been selected, it can't be changed. Phrenic amplifications require the psychic to expend 1 or more points from her phrenic pool to function.																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.60
Psychic Discipline (Ex or Sp)	KEY:Psychic ~ Psychic Discipline				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:Each psychic accesses and improves her mental powers through a particular method, such as rigorous study or attaining a particular mental state. This is called her psychic discipline. She gains additional spells known based on her selected discipline. The choice of discipline must be made at 1st level; once made, it can't be changed. Each psychic discipline gives the psychic a number of discipline powers (at 1st, 5th, and 13th levels), and grants her additional spells known. In addition, the discipline determines which ability score the psychic uses for her phrenic pool and phrenic amplifications abilities. The DC of a saving throw against a psychic discipline ability equals 10 + 1/2 the psychic's level + the psychic's Intelligence modifier. At 1st level, a psychic learns an additional spell determined by her discipline. She learns another additional spell at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, until learning the final one at 18th level. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1-8. Spells learned from a discipline can't be exchanged for different spells at higher levels. Specific psychic disciplines are further described starting on page 64.																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.62
Detect Thoughts			KEY:Psychic ~ Detect Thoughts					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		DESC:At 2nd level, a psychic can use detect thoughts as a spell-like ability once per day. She can also expend any unused spell slot of 1st level or higher to cast detect thoughts. If she does so, she uses the level of the spell slot expended to determine the Will save DC. When a psychic gains this ability, if she knows detect thoughts, she can learn a different 1st-level spell in place of detect thoughts, losing the old spell in exchange for the new one.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.63
Telepathic Bond			KEY:Psychic ~ Telepathic Bond					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		DESC:At 9th level, a psychic can use telepathic bond as a spell-like ability once per day, using her psychic level as her caster level. She can't leave herself out of a bond created in this way. She can also expend any unused spell slot of 4th level or higher to cast telepathic bond. Casting the spell using a higher-level spell slot gives no benefit on its own, but the psychic can apply metamagic feats that would increase the spell level to the appropriate level. For instance, if the psychic knows Extend Spell, she can use a 5th-level spell slot to cast extended telepathic bond as a full-round action. When a psychic who knows telepathic bond gains this ability, she can learn a different 4th-level spell in place of telepathic bond, losing the old spell in exchange for the new one.																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.63
Major Amplifications		KEY:Psychic ~ Major Amplifications				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:At 11th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a psychic can choose one of the following major amplifications in place of a phrenic amplification.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.63
Telepathy				KEY:Psychic ~ Telepathy						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 17th level, the psychic can mentally communicate with any other creature within 100 feet that has a language. It is possible to address multiple creatures at once telepathically, although maintaining a telepathic conversation with more than one creature at a time is just as difficult as both speaking and listening to multiple people at the same time. When a psychic who knows telepathy (see page 189) gains this ability, she can learn a different 5th-level spell in place of telepathy, losing the old spell in exchange for the new one.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.64
Remade Self				KEY:Psychic ~ Remade Self					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		DESC:At 20th level, the psychic is affected by one of the following spells as a constant spell-like ability: arcane sight, f ly, haste, heroism, nondetection, or tongues. This ability is chosen when the psychic reaches 20th level and can't be changed. While the psychic is under the effects of this spell-like ability, each time she casts a psychic spell, she can link one phrenic amplification or major amplification she knows that has a point cost of 1 to that spell without spending any points from her phrenic pool. This amplification is in addition to the normal maximum of one amplification per spell.

# Phrenic Amplifications	# COMMENT: no pool implemented yet
Complex Countermeasure		KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Complex Countermeasure	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to increase by 2 the DCs of concentration checks or caster level checks the linked spell requires enemies to attempt. For example, if the linked spell were nondetection, the DC of the caster level check for using a divination on the warded creature or item would increase. This increase also applies to checks to dispel, counterspell, or identify the linked spell. The bonus applies while the spell is cast and lasts for the spell's duration (if appropriate), to a maximum of 24 hours. The psychic can choose to spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to instead increase the linked spell's DCs by 4.																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.60
Conjured Armor			KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Conjured Armor		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:By spending 1 point from her phrenic pool, the psychic grants any creature she conjures or summons with the linked spell a +2 deflection bonus to AC. This bonus lasts for 1 round per caster level or until the creature disappears, whichever comes first. This amplification can be linked only to conjuration (calling) or conjuration (summoning) spells. The bonus increases to +3 at 8th level and to +4 at 15th level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Defensive Prognostication	KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Defensive Prognostication	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:When casting a divination spell, the psychic sees a glimmer of her future. By spending 1 point from her phrenic pool as she casts a divination spell, she gains a +2 insight bonus to AC for a number of rounds equal to the linked spell's level. She can instead spend 2 points to increase the bonus to +4. This amplification can be linked only to divination spells.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Focused Force			KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Focused Force			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:When casting a force spell, the psychic can increase the spell's damage by spending 1 point from her phrenic pool. Increase the die size for the spell's damage by one step (from 1d4 to 1d6, 1d6 to 1d8, 1d8 to 1d10, or 1d10 to 1d12). This increases the size of each die rolled, so a spell that dealt 4d6+3 points of force damage would deal 4d8+3 points of force damage instead. This amplification can be linked only to spells that deal force damage, and only if that damage includes a die value. A spell that already uses d12s for damage can't be amplified in this way.																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Intense Focus			KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Intense Focus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to gain a +2 bonus on any concentration check she attempts as part of casting the linked spell. She can choose to spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to instead gain a +4 bonus.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Mindshield				KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Mindshield			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to give one target of the linked spell a +2 morale bonus on Will saves for 1 round per psychic level (maximum 10 rounds). The psychic can instead spend 2 points to increase the bonus to +4. If the linked spell affects more than one creature, the psychic can spend the same number of points for each additional creature she wants to affect with this amplification. She must choose to spend either 1 point for each creature or 2 points for each creature; she can't grant different bonuses to different targets.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Mindtouch				KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Mindtouch			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to probe one target's mind if that creature is affected by the linked spell. If the target of the linked spell fails its saving throw or is hit by the spell, the psychic detects its surface thoughts (as the 3rd-round effect of detect thoughts). If the linked spell doesn't already require an attack roll or allow a saving throw, the target can attempt a Will saving throw to avoid the thought-detection effect only; the DC is calculated using the linked spell's level (and all other bonuses that would apply if the linked spell allowed a Will save). This amplification can be linked only to spells that affect a target or an area. If the linked spell can affect more than one creature, the psychic can attempt to detect more than one target's thoughts by spending 1 additional point per creature beyond the first. She must select these targets when she casts the spell and spends the points. This is a mind-affecting effect.																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Ongoing Defense			KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Ongoing Defense		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The psychic can increase the duration of spells that improve her psychic defenses. She can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool when she casts any intellect fortress, mental barrier, thought shield, or tower of iron will spell to extend the spell's duration by 1 round.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Overpowering Mind			KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Overpowering Mind		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to increase the Will save DC of the linked spell by 1. At 8th level, she can choose to instead spend 4 points to increase the DC by 2. At 15th level, she can choose to instead spend 6 points to increase the DC by 3. This amplification can be linked only to spells that have the mind-affecting descriptor and require a Will saving throw.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.62
Relentless Casting		KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Relentless Casting		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to roll twice on any caster level checks to overcome spell resistance required for the linked spell and take the better result. Because she must decide to spend points from her phrenic pool when she starts casting a spell, the psychic must decide to use this ability before the GM calls for the caster level check.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.62
Undercast Surge			KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Undercast Surge		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:When the psychic undercasts a spell (see page 144), she can spend points from her phrenic pool to increase the spell's effective level, essentially using up a lower-level spell slot to cast a higher-level version of the spell. This costs 2 points per spell level increased. She can't use this ability to cast a version higher than the version she knows. For instance, a psychic who knows mind thrust III but not mind thrust IV could cast mind thrust II and spend 2 points to treat it as mind thrust III, but couldn't spend 4 points to treat it as mind thrust IV. This amplification can be linked only to spells that can be undercast.																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.62
Will of the Dead			KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Will of the Dead		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Even undead creatures can be affected by the psychic's mind-affecting spells. The psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to overcome an undead creature's immunity to mind-affecting effects for the purposes of the linked spell. This ability functions even on mindless undead, but has no effect on creatures that aren't undead. This amplification can be linked only to spells that have the mind-affecting descriptor. # Major Amplifications																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.62
# COMMENT: no pool implemented yet
Dispelling Pulse			KEY:Major Amplification ~ Dispelling Pulse		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Major Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:The psychic can spend 3 points from her phrenic pool to entwine dispelling magic with a targeted spell. If the target is hit by the linked spell or fails its saving throw, it's affected as though the psychic had cast a targeted dispel magic spell on it. This effect can dispel only spells of the linked spell's level or lower. If the linked spell doesn't already require an attack roll or allow a saving throw, the target can attempt a Will saving throw to avoid the dispelling effect only; the DC is calculated using the linked spell's level (and all other bonuses that would apply if the linked spell allowed a Will save). This amplification can be linked only to a spell that targets one creature or object.																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.63
Dual Amplification		KEY:Major Amplification ~ Dual Amplification		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Major Amplification.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:When the psychic uses this major amplification, she chooses two other amplifications or major amplifications she knows to apply to the same linked spell. She must spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to do so, plus the full cost of the two other amplifications. She can't apply the same amplification to the linked spell more than once, even if she can use that amplification for multiple different effects.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.63
Mimic Metamagic			KEY:Major Amplification ~ Mimic Metamagic			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Major Amplification.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:When the psychic gains this amplification, she chooses two metamagic feats; she need not have these feats to select them. When she casts a spell, she can spend points from her phrenic pool to apply one of the chosen feats to the linked spell without increasing the spell's level or casting time. She must spend a number of points equal to double the number of levels by which the feat normally increases a spell's level (minimum 2 points). If the metamagic feat alters the spell's casting time in a different way than the standard rules for a spontaneous caster using a metamagic feat (as in the case of Quicken Spell), it changes the casting time accordingly. The psychic can still apply metamagic feats she knows to the spell while using this amplification, increasing the casting time and spell level as normal. This amplification can be applied only to a spell that the chosen metamagic feat could normally affect, and only if the spellcaster can cast spells of a high enough level that she would be able to apply the metamagic feat in question to the linked spell. For example, an 11th-level psychic could spend 8 points to quicken a 1st-level spell, but couldn't quicken a 2nd-level spell because she's unable to cast 6th-level spells. This ability doesn't require her to have any free spell slots in the relevant level, however, so the psychic in the example could quicken a 1st-level spell even if she had cast all her 5th-level spells for the day. A psychic can select this amplification multiple times, adding two additional options to the list of metamagic feats she can apply using this amplification each time.																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.63
Space-rending Spell		KEY:Major Amplification ~ Space-rending Spell		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Major Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:The psychic can warp space with her mind, teleporting herself as she casts her linked spell. She teleports herself 10 feet per point she spends from her phrenic pool (as dimension door). The maximum number of points she can spend in this way is equal to the linked spell's level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.63
Subordinate Spell			KEY:Major Amplification ~ Subordinate Spell		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Major Amplification.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:The psychic can divide her mind to cast a less powerful spell upon herself alongside her linked spell. The linked spell can't be lower than 5th level and can't take less than a standard action to cast. This applies to the actual casting time, so the psychic can't add a subordinate spell to a quickened spell. The subordinate spell's casting time must be 1 standard action or less, and its level can be no higher than the linked spell's level - 5. The subordinate spell must target only the psychic (even if it could normally affect other or multiple targets). The psychic must spend a number of points from her phrenic pool equal to 3 + double the subordinate spell's level. The subordinate spell acts as though it had been cast, and uses up one of the psychic's spells per day of its level. The effects of the two spells are separate, so each might require its own concentration check.																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.64
Synaptic Shock			KEY:Major Amplification ~ Synaptic Shock			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Major Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:The psychic manipulates an enemy's mind with brute force, causing mental harm beyond that done by her linked spell. She can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool when casting a mind-affecting linked spell to select one of the spell's targets. If the target is affected by the linked spell, that target is confused for 1 round after the duration of the spell expires (or immediately, if the spell has an instantaneous duration). If the target succeeds at its save against the linked spell, it is instead confused for 1 round immediately. For each additional point the psychic spends from her phrenic pool, she can confuse one additional target of the linked spell. This amplification can be applied only to a mind-affecting spell that can affect a number of targets or that has an area. It has no effect on creatures that are immune to mind-affecting effects, unless the linked spell is able to affect such creatures (such as a spell that has both will of the dead and synaptic shock applied to it via dual amplification).																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.64
Turning Shield			KEY:Major Amplification ~ Turning Shield			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Major Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:The psychic can turn her excess spell energy into a barrier that def lects weaker spells. She can spend a number of points from her phrenic pool equal to the linked spell's level to gain the benefit of spell turning for 1 round per psychic level. The number of spell levels she can turn is equal to the level of the linked spell.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency			KEY:Spiritualist ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:A spiritualist is proficient with all simple weapons, kukris, saps, and scythes, as well as with light armor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.72
Spells						KEY:Spiritualist ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:A spiritualist casts psychic spells drawn from the spiritualist spell list (see page 76). She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell's level. To learn or cast a spell, a spiritualist must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a spiritualist's spell equals 10 + the spell level + the spiritualist's Wisdom modifier. A spiritualist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-9: Spiritualist. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). A spiritualist's selection of spells is limited. A spiritualist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the spiritualist's choice. At each new spiritualist level, she learns one or more new spells as indicated on Table 1-10: Spiritualist Spells Known. Unlike her number of spells per day, the number of spells a spiritualist knows does not affect her Wisdom score. The numbers on Table 1-10 are fixed. Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third spiritualist level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a spiritualist can learn a single new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the spiritualist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spiritualist spell she can cast. A spiritualist can swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.72
Knacks						KEY:Spiritualist ~ Knacks					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:A spiritualist learns a number of knacks, or 0-level psychic spells, as noted on Table 1-10 under Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they can be cast any number of times per day. Knacks prepared using another spell slot, because of metamagic feats applied to them, for example, consume spell slots as normal.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.72
Phantom						KEY:Spiritualist ~ Phantom					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:A spiritualist begins play with the aid of a powerful and versatile spirit entity called a phantom. The phantom forms a link with the spiritualist, who forever after can either harbor the creature within her consciousness or manifest it as an ectoplasmic or incorporeal entity. A phantom has the same alignment as the spiritualist, and it can speak all the languages its master can. A spiritualist can harbor her phantom in her consciousness (see the shared consciousness class feature on page 73), manifest it partially (see the bonded manifestation class feature on page 74), or fully manifest it. A fully manifested phantom is treated as a summoned creature from the Ethereal Plane, except it is not sent back to the Ethereal Plane until it is reduced to a negative amount of hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score. A spiritualist can fully manifest her phantom through a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When the phantom is fully manifested, the spiritualist can change the form of the phantom's manifestation (either from ectoplasmic to incorporeal or vice versa) as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. When the phantom manifests, its hit points are unchanged from the last time it manifested, unless the phantom was slain and returned to the Ethereal Plane; in this case, the phantom manifests with half its maximum number of hit points. The phantom does not heal naturally, and can be healed only with magic or by being tended to with the Heal skill while fully manifested in ectoplasmic form. The phantom stays fully manifested until it is either returned to the spiritualist's consciousness (a standard action) or banished to the Ethereal Plane. If the phantom is banished to the Ethereal Plane, it can't return to the spiritualist's consciousness or manifest again for 24 hours. While fully manifested, a phantom can't be returned to the Ethereal Plane by means of dispel magic, but spells such as dismissal and banishment work normally. Whenever the spiritualist is unconscious or asleep, the phantom immediately returns to the spiritualist's consciousness. If the spiritualist dies, the phantom is returned to the Ethereal Plane, and can't return to the spiritualist's consciousness until 24 hours after the spiritualist is brought back to life. A phantom can't be dismissed or banished (by a spell or any other similar effect) while it resides in the spiritualist's consciousness, as the phantom is protected from such effects by the power of the spiritualist's psyche. Fully manifested phantoms can wear armor and use items (though not wield weapons) appropriate to their forms. Any items worn, carried, or held by a phantom are dropped when the phantom returns to the spiritualist's consciousness, and must be retrieved and donned anew if the phantom wishes to use them when it fully manifests in the future. Phantoms are self-involved, even jealous, creatures that do not play well with other summoned companions. A phantom refuses to manifest (either fully or as part of a bonded manifestation; see Bonded Manifestation on page 74) in the presence of an eidolon or shadow summoned by the phantom's master. Furthermore, if a phantom is manifested when such a creature is summoned, it immediately retreats into its spiritualist's consciousness, and will not manifest again until the eidolon or shadow is dismissed. A fully manifested phantom's abilities, feats, Hit Dice, saving throws, and skills are tied to the spiritualist's class level and increase as the spiritualist gains levels. See the Phantoms section starting on page 78 for more information.	SOURCEPAGE:p.72
Shared Consciousness				KEY:Spiritualist ~ Shared Consciousness			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, while a phantom is confined in a spiritualist's consciousness (but not while it's fully manifested or banished to the Ethereal Plane), it grants the spiritualist the Skill Focus feat in two skills determined by the phantom's emotional focus, unless the spiritualist already has Skill Focus in those skills. It also grants a +4 bonus on saving throws against all mind-affecting effects; at 12th level, this bonus increases to +8. Lastly, once per day, when the spiritualist fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, as an immediate action she can shunt that effect into the phantom's section of her consciousness instead. When she does so, she is not affected by the mind-affecting effect, but for the normal duration of that effect, the spiritualist loses the bonuses on saving throws against mind-affecting effects and the Skill Focus effects granted by her phantom, and can't use this ability to shunt a mind-affecting effect into the phantom's consciousness or manifest her phantom in any way. When a mind-affecting effect is shunted into the phantom's consciousness, spells such as dispel magic and break enchantment can be cast on the spiritualist to end the effect's duration as if the spiritualist were affected by the mind-affecting effect.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.73
Etheric Tether					KEY:Spiritualist ~ Etheric Tether				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a spiritualist can force the phantom to manifest in an area around her by pushing the phantom's consciousness though the veil of ethereal essence, allowing it to fully manifest in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form. Whenever her manifested phantom takes enough damage to send it back to the Ethereal Plane, as a reaction to the damage, the spiritualist can sacrifice any number of her hit points without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the phantom. This can prevent the phantom from being sent back to the Ethereal Plane. This tether is limited. When the phantom is fully manifested, it and the spiritualist must remain within 50 feet of one another for the phantom's manifestation to stay stable with little to no concentration on the part of the spiritualist. The spiritualist can stretch the limited tether, but only when the phantom is in ectoplasmic form. When a spiritualist starts her turn and her ectoplasmic phantom is more than 50 feet away from her (but closer than 100 feet), the spiritualist must concentrate on the link as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity or the ectoplasmic phantom immediately returns to the Ethereal Plane and cannot be summoned from that plane for 24 hours. This concentration can be interrupted as if it were a spell. Treat this effect's spell level as equal to 1 + 1 per 10 feet farther than 50 feet that the phantom is from the spiritualist (maximum spell level 6th). If the tether is interrupted or the check fails, the phantom immediately snaps back into the consciousness of its spiritualist master. If the ectoplasmic phantom is ever more than 100 feet away from its spiritualist, or the incorporeal phantom is ever 50 feet away from the spiritualist or outside of line of effect from the spiritualist for more than 1 round per spiritualist level the spiritualist possesses, the tether is automatically broken; the phantom immediately returns to the Ethereal Plane and can't be summoned from that plane for 24 hours. See the Phantoms section starting on page 78 for more information.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Bonded Senses					KEY:Spiritualist ~ Bonded Senses				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 2nd level, as a standard action, a spiritualist can share the senses of her manifested phantom, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and feeling everything her phantom does. She can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to her spiritualist level, but those rounds do not need to be consecutive. There is no maximum range for this effect, but the phantom and the spiritualist must be on the same plane. The spiritualist can end this effect as a free action.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Bonded Manifestation				KEY:Spiritualist ~ Bonded Manifestation			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 3rd level, as a swift action, a spiritualist can pull on the consciousness of her phantom and the substance of the Ethereal Plane to partially manifest aspects of both in her own body. When she does, she uses this bonded manifestation to enhance her own abilities while the phantom is still bound to her consciousness. For the spiritualist to use this ability, the phantom must be confined in the spiritualist's consciousness; it can't be manifested in any other way. During a bonded manifestation, the phantom can't be damaged, dismissed, or banished. A spiritualist can use bonded manifestation a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + her spiritualist level. The rounds need not be consecutive. She can dismiss the effects of a bonded manifestation as a free action, but even if she dismisses a bonded manifestation on the same round that she used it, it counts as 1 round of use. When a spiritualist uses this ability, she must choose either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form. When she makes this choice, she gains all of the abilities based on the form she chooses and her spiritualist level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Ectoplasmic Bonded Manifestation		KEY:Spiritualist ~ Ectoplasmic Bonded Manifestation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:When a spiritualist uses this ability and chooses ectoplasmic form, she gains an ectoplasmic shield that protects her without restricting her movement or actions. She gains a +4 shield bonus to Armor Class; this bonus applies to incorporeal touch attacks. The ectoplasmic shield has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance. At 8th level, the spiritualist also sprouts a pair of ectoplasmic tendrils from her body. Once per round as either a swift or a standard action (spiritualist's choice), the spiritualist can use one or both tendrils to attack creatures within her melee reach (using the attack bonus and damage dice of her ectoplasmic manifested phantom) or to manipulate objects. She can even use that action to have one tendril make an attack and the other manipulate an object, as long as that object can be manipulated with one hand. At 13th level, the phantom's ectoplasm clings to the spiritualist like a suit of armor. This grants the spiritualist a +6 armor bonus to AC without imposing an armor check penalty, an arcane spell failure chance, or any reduction in speed. At 18th level, the spiritualist can take a full-round action to attack all creatures within her melee reach with her tendrils (using the attack bonus and damage dice of her ectoplasmic manifested phantom). When she does, she rolls the attack roll twice, takes the better of the two results, and uses that as her attack roll result against all creatures within her melee reach. If the better attack roll threatens a critical hit, the spiritualist chooses one target that she hit to confirm the critical hit against. The other attacks that hit are considered normal hits rather than critical threats. Incorporeal Bonded Manifestation: When a spiritualist uses this ability and chooses incorporeal form, she becomes shrouded in a haze of insubstantial mist, granting her concealment against ranged attacks. At 8th level, the spiritualist can better affect incorporeal creatures with melee attacks; her unarmed strikes and melee weapon attacks are treated as if they had the ghost touch magic weapon special ability. At 13th level, the spiritualist can take a standard action to become invisible (as the invisibility spell) until the start of her next turn. At 18th level, the spiritualist gains the incorporeal subtype and a f ly speed of 30 feet (good) while using this form of bonded manifestation. Spiritual Interference (Ex or Su): At 4th level, whenever a spiritualist is within the reach of her ectoplasmic manifested phantom, she gains a +2 shield bonus to her Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on her saving throws. She doesn't gain these bonuses when the ectoplasmic manifested phantom is grappled, helpless, or unconscious. A spiritualist within 30 feet of her incorporeally manifested phantom receives a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against mindaffecting effects. This bonus is a supernatural ability and does not apply if the phantom is unconscious.

Detect Undead					KEY:Spiritualist ~ Detect Undead				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:At 5th level, a spiritualist's connection with the Ethereal Plane becomes so strong that she can use detect undead at will as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to her spiritualist level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.75
Phantom Recall					KEY:Spiritualist ~ Phantom Recall				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 6th level, as either a swift or an immediate action, a spiritualist can call her manifested phantom to her side or back into her consciousness. This ability functions as dimension door, using the spiritualist's class level as the caster level. When the spiritualist calls the phantom in this way, the phantom appears adjacent to the spiritualist (or as close as possible, if all adjacent spaces are occupied). When the spiritualist uses this ability to call the phantom back to her consciousness, she can activate bonded manifestation as part of that action, but doing so costs 1 extra round of bonded manifestation. The spiritualist can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 spiritualist levels she possesses beyond 6th.

Calm Spirit						KEY:Spiritualist ~ Calm Spirit				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:At 7th level, a spiritualist gains the ability to use calm spirit (see page 160) as a spell-like ability once per day. At 11th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the spiritualist can use this ability an additional time per day (to a maximum of 4 times per day at 19th level).

Fused Consciousness				KEY:Spiritualist ~ Fused Consciousness			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 10th level, a spiritualist always gains the benefits of bonded senses when her phantom is manifested. She also gains the skill ranks and bonus to mind-affecting spells granted by the spirit's emotional focus (see page 80), even when her phantom is manifested.

###Block: Occult Skill Unlocks
AUTOMATIC WRITING (LINGUISTICS)	KEY:Skill Unlock ~ AUTOMATIC WRITING	SOURCEPAGE:p.194	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkillUnlock.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:DISPLAY		DESC:You can produce mysterious writing that pertains to the immediate future, either under the inf luence of enigmatic guiding spirits or by unleashing your subconscious intuition. Check: Once per week, you can spend 1 hour posing questions while your hand unconsciously scribbles messages of varying legibility and accuracy. At the end of this hour, you attempt a Linguistics check to decipher the meanings of these messages. If successful, you gain information as though you had used augury. If you have 10 or more ranks in Linguistics, you can attempt a higher DC check to instead gain information as though you had used divination. The chance of successfully producing coherent or meaningful writing from any of these effects equals 60% plus 5% for every 1 by which your check result exceeds the DC (to a maximum of 90%). You must choose which DC you'll try to meet before attempting the check. The GM rolls the check and d% roll secretly, so that you can't tell whether the messages are accurate. Action: Automatic writing takes 1 hour. Try Again: Yes. You can attempt to learn more about a subject, but can still attempt only one check per week.
DOWSING (SURVIVAL)			KEY:Skill Unlock ~ DOWSING			SOURCEPAGE:p.195	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkillUnlock.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:DISPLAY		DESC:You channel mysterious forces in the nearby environment to locate hidden resources. Check: Once per day, you can follow a dowsing rod's movements to locate a particular type of location. Each attempt requires 10 minutes of intense concentration, after which you attempt the Survival check with the DC listed on the table below. The maximum range at which you can detect anything using dowsing is 400 feet + 40 feet per rank in Survival you possess. The rod's directions persist for up to 10 minutes. You choose a particular target each time you dowse, and get the following information on a successful check. Find Water: The dowsing rod points toward the largest source of fresh water within range, including aquifers, lakes, ponds, and springs. Grave Dowsing: The dowsing rod points in the direction of the largest burial site, cairn, or tomb within range. Locate Metal and Gems: You concentrate on a specific metal or mineral. On a successful check, the dowsing rod points to the largest quantity of the selected mineral within range. Action: Dowsing attempts take 10 minutes to initiate. The results of the check persist for 10 minutes afterward. Try Again: Yes. You can try to dowse from the same location more than once, but still only once per day.
FAITH HEALING (HEAL)			KEY:Skill Unlock ~ FAITH HEALING		SOURCEPAGE:p.195	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkillUnlock.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:DISPLAY		DESC:You apply esoteric principles to temporarily suspend or remove curses, diseases, and ability damage. Check: You can use faith healing once per day. The DC and effect of the Heal check depend on the task you attempt. You can't use faith healing on yourself. Restore Vitality: You suppress ability damage. You perform a 1-hour ceremony, after which you attempt a Heal check against the DC of the effect that caused the ability damage. If you succeed at the check, you temporarily suppress 1 point of ability damage for 1 hour, plus 1 additional point and hour for every 5 by which the check result exceeds the DC. A creature can benefit from this treatment no more than once per day. Suspend Aff liction: You treat one curse, disease, or poison affecting a creature. You enter into a deep trance for 1 hour while you treat the subject, after which you attempt your Heal check. If the check is successful, you suspend the effects of the aff liction by 1 hour, plus 1 hour for every 5 by which you exceed the DC. This time doesn't count against the effect's duration (if any). The aff liction can still be cured by other means while it's suspended. Remove Aff liction: You can attempt to permanently remove an aff liction in an 8-hour ceremony, after which you attempt a Heal check. If the result of the check is at least double the DC of the original aff liction, the sufferer can attempt another saving throw using the original DC to permanently cast off the effect. Action: Restoring vitality and suspending aff lictions each require 1 hour in a quiet environment. Permanent removal of aff lictions requires 8 hours of heavy activity. Try Again: Varies. A creature can't be the subject of faith healing more than once per day. You can't try to permanently remove an aff liction again.
HYPNOTISM (DIPLOMACY)			KEY:Skill Unlock ~ HYPNOTISM			SOURCEPAGE:p.195	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkillUnlock.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:DISPLAY		DESC:You use the power of suggestion and subtle psychic inf luence to alter a subject's mind and dredge up repressed memories. Check: You can use hypnotism once per day. The DC of a Diplomacy check to hypnotize is 20 + the subject's Will save modifier against mind-affecting enchantment (compulsion) effects. All uses of hypnotism are mindaffecting enchantment (compulsion) effects. Implant Suggestion: You can implant a suggested course of reasonable action in the mind of a willing creature, along with a defined trigger. To implant a suggestion, you spend 1 minute inducing a trance-like state in the subject, after which you attempt a Diplomacy check. If the check is successful, you implant the course of action, as a suggestion spell with a duration of 10 minutes plus 10 additional minutes for every 1 by which your check result exceeds the DC. If the subject ceases to be willing, it can attempt a Will save once each round to shake off the effects. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma modifier. You can attempt to subtly implant a suggestion in the mind of an unwilling creature with an attitude of indifferent or better after 1 minute of continuous, calm interaction with that creature, but the DC is 10 higher. Recall Memory: You can draw out forgotten memories from a willing subject. You spend 1 minute inducing a calming, trance-like state in the subject, after which you attempt a Diplomacy check. If you succeed at the check, the hypnotized creature can reroll any previously failed Intelligence or Knowledge check to recall the forgotten information with a +4 bonus. The information must be something the subject once knew or was exposed to. Action: Hypnotism takes 1 minute of calm interaction. Try Again: Yes. You can try to hypnotize the same creature more than once, but only once per day.
PHRENOLOGY (KNOWLEDGE [ARCANA])	KEY:Skill Unlock ~ PHRENOLOGY			SOURCEPAGE:p.196	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkillUnlock.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:DISPLAY		DESC:You examine the skulls of intelligent creatures to analyze the subjects' psychological attributes, since the shape of the brain inf luences the shape of the skull. Check: Once per day, you can use your fingertips to examine the shape of a creature's skull. Reading a creature's skull requires 1 minute of concentration and scrutiny while you physically manipulate the skull. This technique can be used on a willing, helpless, or paralyzed creature, or on decomposed remains (as long as the skull is intact or can be pieced together). This skill can't be used on creatures without discernible skulls, such as constructs, elementals, oozes, or plants. After the minute is up, the GM attempts a secret Knowledge (arcana) check. The DC is typically modified by the subject's Hit Dice. With a single check, you determine all the information whose DC you meet. For instance, if you had a result of 22 when examining a creature with 2 HD, you would learn that creature's race and age, gender, alignment, and class, but not its level or HD. Action: Reading a creature's cranium requires 1 minute of uninterrupted study. Try Again: Yes. Reexamining a skull may provide new insights. You can attempt only one such check per day.
PROGNOSTICATION (SENSE MOTIVE)	KEY:Skill Unlock ~ PROGNOSTICATION		SOURCEPAGE:p.196	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkillUnlock.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:DISPLAY		DESC:You are skilled in means of folk divination. The most common methods are cartomancy (reading cards), cheiromancy (reading a creature's palms), crystallomancy (crystal-gazing), extispicy (reading animal entrails), horoscopy (reading a creature's birth stars), oneiromancy (interpreting dreams), osteomancy (reading cast bones), and pyromancy (reading f lames). Check: Once per day, you can predict a creature's fortune for the near future. You spend 10 minutes interpreting the divination means at your disposal. The GM then attempts a secret Sense Motive check with a DC modified by the subject's Hit Dice (see the table below). The result of the check can give you basic insight into the subject's nature, including its alignment, class, and levels or Hit Dice, and might reveal clues to the creature's immediate future. Determining the immediate future as an augury spell has a chance of successfully interpreting meaningful readings equal to 60% plus 5% for every point by which the check result exceeds the DC (to a maximum of 90%). With a single check, you determine all the information whose DC you meet. For instance, if you had a result of 22 when telling the fortune of a creature with 2 HD, you would learn that creature's alignment and class, but not its level, HD, or fortune. Action: Reading a creature's fortune requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted contemplation, and the subject creature must be present. Try Again: Yes. You can attempt to read a particular creature's fortune repeatedly, but only once per 24 hours. Special: Specially crafted items purchased for the exclusive use of this skill grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Sense Motive checks to prognosticate.
PSYCHOMETRY (APPRAISE)			KEY:Skill Unlock ~ PSYCHOMETRY		SOURCEPAGE:p.196	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkillUnlock.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:DISPLAY		DESC:You can read the psychic impressions left on objects or in places by previous owners and events. Check: Once per day, you can concentrate for 1 minute while in physical contact with an item or location, during which you receive f lashes of insight regarding the subject's nature and ownership. After 1 minute, you attempt a DC 15 Appraise check to decipher the visions. You gain one piece of information about the historical significance or the last previous owner-such as a glimpse of the last owner's appearance or its emotional state when it last used the item-determined by the GM. You learn one more piece of information for every 10 by which your check result exceeds the DC, as long as you concentrate for 1 additional minute for each piece of information. If you fail the check by less than 5 or the item has no significant psychic imprint, you don't learn any information. If you fail this check by 5 or more, the item appears to be psychically significant even if it's not, and the information you gain is wildly inaccurate. If you attempt to use psychometry on an item affected by charge object or implant false reading, you automatically learn all information imprinted by the spell. You must also attempt a Will save. If the item is affected by an implant false reading spell, on a success, you realize the information was false, and can determine the true information as well. On a failure, or if the item is affected by a charge object spell, you believe the information is true. Action: Reading an object requires at least 1 minute of uninterrupted concentration. Try Again: Yes. Multiple readings on an object or place always give the same results unless its circumstances or ownership have changed, but additional checks might reach further back into an object's history. You don't reroll the saving throw to determine if a psychic imprint is false. You can still use psychometry only once per day.
READ AURA (PERCEPTION)			KEY:Skill Unlock ~ READ AURA			SOURCEPAGE:p.197	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkillUnlock.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:DISPLAY		DESC:Your psychic sensitivity allows you to read the psychic and magical auras of creatures and objects. Check: Once per day, you can examine the natural aura of a creature or object to discern the subject's alignment, emotions, health, or magic. This requires 10 minutes of concentration, after which you attempt a Perception check. Each time, you must pick one of four auras to read: alignment, emotion, health, or magic. The result of the check applies only to the selected aura. You must be within 30 feet of the subject at all times during the reading. Objects typically have only magic auras, though some also have alignment auras (and intelligent items have emotion auras). You can still attempt to detect a type of aura an object doesn't have, but you get no results. The DC varies depending on the aura, as shown on the table. Read Alignment Aura: You attempt to read the alignment aura, learning the alignment and its strength. An alignment aura's strength depends on the creature's Hit Dice or item's caster level, as noted in the description of the detect evil spell. Read Emotion Aura: The colors within the target's aura reveal its emotional state. If successful, you learn the target's disposition and its attitude toward any creatures within 30 feet of it. For a number of rounds equal to the amount by which you exceeded the skill check's DC, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks against the target. Read Health Aura: Viewing the f low of vital force, you assess a creature's physical condition. You learn if the creature is unharmed or wounded, if it is poisoned or diseased, and whether it is affected by any of the following conditions: confused, disabled, dying, nauseated, panicked, staggered, stunned, and unconscious. You also learn the total number of points available in its ki pool, grit pool, or similar resource. Read Magic Aura: You attempt to determine the number and power of all magical auras on a target creature or object (see detect magic to determine a magic aura's power). If the check is successful, you can attempt Knowledge (arcana) or Spellcraft checks to determine the school or identify properties of a magic item, as normal. If the item is affected by magic aura or a similar spell, you can realize this and determine the actual properties of the item if your check result exceeds the DC by 5 or more. If the spell is of a higher level (such as aura alteration), increase this threshold DC by 2 for every spell level beyond 1st. Action: Reading an aura requires 10 minutes of study. Try Again: Yes. You can read a creature or object's aura more than once, whether you read the same aura or a different one. You can still attempt only one skill check to read an aura per day.
