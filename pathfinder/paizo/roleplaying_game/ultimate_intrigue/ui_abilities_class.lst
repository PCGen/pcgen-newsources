Weapon and Armor Proficiencies	KEY:Vigilante ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiencies		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.2	DESC:Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).
Dual Identity				KEY:Vigilante ~ Dual Identity					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.2	DESC:Starting at 1st level, a vigilante learns to hide his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of being a ruthless vigilante. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names, his true name used in polite company and his vigilante name used to strike fear in those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante has been captured and his identity revealed to the world at large. The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 5 minutes and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante's secrets. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); it often also involves make-up, hair, and other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items like hat of disguise do not reduce the time required to change identities. Many of the class features of the vigilante are usable only when the vigilante is in one of his two identities, as noted in the ability. A vigilante can possess two alignments, one for each of his identity. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity's alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that target alignment. For the purposes of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or other ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante's two alignments must be within one step of each other. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is neutral, lawful good, lawful neutral, or lawful evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both alignments to the new alignment. Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in an identity known to the creature attempting to locate him. If he is in an identity unknown to the creature, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness as if the target was invalid or did not exist.
Social Grace				KEY:Vigilante ~ Social Grace					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.3	DESC:Starting at 1st level, a vigilante learns to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his chosen social identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while in his social identity, he can make a Disguise skill check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as a member of polite society. Starting at 2nd level, the vigilante can select any one Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill. Whenever the vigilante is in his social identity, he receives a +4 circumstance bonus on checks with the selected skill. At 6th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, he can select another skill (with the same restrictions) to gain this bonus.
Vigilante Specialization		KEY:Vigilante ~ Vigilante Specialization			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.3	DESC:At 1st level, a vigilante must select a specialization that determines many of the abilities granted to him when he assumes his vigilante identity. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Each specialization grants a base ability at 1st level and a number of class skills. In addition, each specialization has a number of unique talents that can be selected with the talent class feature. The base ability and bonus class skills apply when the vigilante is in either of his identities, but all of the other abilities are available only when he is in his vigilante identity, unless stated otherwise. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante's level + the vigilante's Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.

Vigilante Talent				KEY:Vigilante ~ Vigilante Talent				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.3	DESC:Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. When choosing a talent, a vigilante can select from among any of the talents listed in his vigilante specialization. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.	DEFINE:Vigilante_Talent_Count|0	BONUS:VAR|Vigilante_Talent_Count|VigilanteLVL/2
Renown					KEY:Vigilante ~ Renown						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.3	DESC:At 3rd level, a vigilante becomes known for deeds and abilities, regardless of his current identity. This renown grants him favorable treatment in civilized company and lends and air of menace while facing down his enemies. While he is in his social identity, a vigilante can spend 1 week gaining renown among the locals of any community of no more than about 200 individuals (a village if using settlement statistics). This could be the entire community or a smaller neighborhood in a larger settlement. He must spend at least 4 hours each day socializing and making contacts. After spending 1 week, whenever he is in his social identity, all NPCs treat their starting attitude toward him as one category better, as long as their initial attitude would have at least been indifferent (see the Diplomacy skills on pages 93-94 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). While he gains renown in an area using his social identity, he also spreads rumors and tales about his vigilante identity. Once he has gained renown in a community, whenever he is in his vigilante identity, he gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Intimidate skill checks. This bonus applies only while he is within a number of miles equal to his vigilante level from the community in which he has gained renown. A vigilante can hold renown in only a limited number of communities (one or possibly two at higher levels). If he gains renown in a new community, he must decide which one of his previous communities to lose. These bonuses and abilities are subject to GM approval. The GM might rule that an NPC or monster has not heard the tales or, in rare cases, might respond negatively if the NPC targeted by the check is a foe of the vigilante. At 9th level, the vigilante can gain renown in a single community of up to 5,000 individuals (a large town) or up to two smaller communities of no more than 2,000 individuals each (two small towns). The bonus while he is in his social identity remains unchanged, but the circumstance bonus to Intimidate while he is in his vigilante identity increases to +6. At 15th level, the vigilante can gain renown in a single community of up to 25,000 individuals (a large city) or up to two smaller cities of no more than 10,000 individuals each (two small cities). The bonus while he is in his social identity remains unchanged, but the circumstance bonus to Intimidate while in he is in his vigilante identity increases to +8.
Startling Appearance			KEY:Vigilante ~ Startling Appearance			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.4	DESC:At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante's presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as f latfooted for the rest of the vigilante's turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge) and the foe takes a -4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante's next turn.
Loyal Aid					KEY:Vigilante ~ Loyal Aid					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.4	DESC:At 7th level, a vigilante gains the service of a number of loyal allies that can help him gather information, cover for his two identities, or perform minor tasks. Inside his area of renown, a vigilante with this ability gains a bonus on Diplomacy checks made to gather information equal to 1/2 his vigilante level. In addition, if the vigilante wants, he can task his friends to help cover for him by spreading false tales of his location and activities to others. This has the effect of increasing the DC of Diplomacy checks made to gather information about the vigilante and Survival checks made to track him by an amount equal to his level. This lasts for 1 day, and can be used only once per week. Finally, once per day, the vigilante can ask his allies to perform a minor task for him. This usually involves delivering a message, purchasing a piece of mundane gear worth 100 gp or less (which the vigilante must pay for), or retrieving an object owned by the vigilante (that would be easily accessible by the ally). This task might take other forms as well, subject to GM discretion, but can never involve combat or danger.
Many Guises					KEY:Vigilante ~ Many Guises					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.4	DESC:At 9th level, a vigilante can take on any number of mundane guises. Whenever he changes his identity, he has a third option (instead of social or vigilante): he can become mundane. The mundane identity is not a specific individual. Each one is created at the moment it is assumed, and quickly forgotten as soon as it is removed. While in a mundane identity, the vigilante does not gain the benefit of either his social or vigilante identity, but instead appears as a member of his race, usually a common laborer, farmer, or peasant of any gender. His alignment is treated as neutral when he is in his mundane identity. While in this identity, he has a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise skill checks to appear like an ordinary member of his race. Spells and abilities that are looking for the vigilante in either of his other identities fail while he is in his mundane identity. He must build the appearance for this identity using whatever clothing and tools he has at his disposal. While he can use magic (such as a hat of disguise), his mundane identity can never be anything other than an ordinary member of a society or large group (subject to GM discretion).
Frightening Appearance			KEY:Vigilante ~ Frightening Appearance			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.5	DESC:At 11th level, whenever the vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante's presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, make an Intimidate skill check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies with 10 feet who witness the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of his attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds on a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante's class level + his Charisma modifier). Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful) it is immune to that vigilante's frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
Quick Change				KEY:Vigilante ~ Quick Change					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.5	DESC:At 13th level, a vigilante learns to shift between his identities with ease. Instead of needing 5 minutes to change his identity, he can now do so as a fullround action. If he uses this ability and he encounters any creature familiar with both of his identities, he must make a Disguise skill check to avoid the creature seeing through his hastily donned disguise and realizing that they are, in fact, the same person. The vigilante can spend 1 minute adjusting and perfecting his appearance to negate the need for this check.
Stunning Appearance			KEY:Vigilante ~ Stunning Appearance				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.5	DESC:At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante's presence (see startling appearance above), the foe must make a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante's level + the vigilante's Charisma modifier or be stunned until the end of the vigilante's next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante's level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the save is successful), it is immune to that vigilante's stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
Everyman					KEY:Vigilante ~ Everyman					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.5	DESC:At 19th level, a vigilante can take on the appearance of a specific individual whenever he assumes a mundane guise. The individual must be a farmer, laborer, or peasant. While disguised as this individual, the vigilante receives a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise skill checks to appear as that individual and any spell or ability designed to locate the individual has a 50% chance of finding the vigilante or the actual individual. Although this doesn't grant the vigilante any special knowledge of the individual, the vigilante's training grants him a +10 circumstance bonus on Bluff skill checks to properly play the part of the specific individual.
Vengeance Strike				KEY:Vigilante ~ Vengeance Strike				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.5	DESC:At 20th level, a vigilante can spend a standard action to study a target that is unaware of the vigilante (or does not see him as a threat). He can continue to spend standard actions in this way, up to a maximum of 5 standard actions, but all must be spent in consecutive rounds. After studying a target, the vigilante can, in the next round, declare that he is making a vengeance strike against the target. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante can grant himself a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, gain +3d6 points of precision damage, or treat his die roll as if it were 2 higher for the purpose of determining if the attack hit or if it threatens a critical hit (maximum 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way, but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. A vengeance strike must be declared within 1 round of studying a target and all rounds of study are expended when the vigilante declares a vengeance strike.

# Talents
Another Day			KEY:Stalker Vigilante Talent ~ Another Day			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Stalker Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:When the stalker vigilante is dropped unconscious due to hit point damage, he automatically stabilizes, but he also appears to be dead, unless an examining creature succeeds at a Heal check (DC = 20 + the stalker’s vigilante level) or a caster level check with the same DC if using magic like deathwatch (affecting spells is supernatural; the rest of the ability is extraordinary). The stalker vigilante counts as having received aid and automatically succeeds at the Constitution check to become conscious after 1 hour (unless he has actually died in the meantime).
Case the Joint		KEY:Stalker Vigilante Talent ~ Case the Joint			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Stalker Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The stalker vigilante can use his social identity to learn important facts about a location before returning later in his vigilante identity. If he spends at least 1 hour in a location while in his social identity, he can attempt a DC 20 Knowledge (engineering) check. If he succeeds, he gains the ability to reroll any one failed skill check involving the location’s layout (such as Stealth to sneak into the location, Disable Device to disable an alarm, or Sleight of Hand to snatch an object from a pedestal). For every 10 by which the check exceeds 20, the stalker gains an additional reroll. If the stalker vigilante fails to return to the location within one week, the situation changes too much, and he cannot use the rerolls. A stalker vigilante cannot case the same joint more than once a week.
Expose Weakness		KEY:Stalker Vigilante Talent ~ Expose Weakness			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Stalker Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The stalker vigilante can use sneaky tricks in order to make it easier to damage a foe, whether it be throwing a fine dust of cold iron over a fey or melting a glob of silver onto a lycanthrope’s hide. The stalker vigilante can add the ability to reduce a creature’s damage reduction or hardness by 10 to the list of options when attempting a dirty trick combat maneuver check (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player’s Guide 320). This does not stack with itself, and it does not work against creatures with DR/—.
Foe Collision*		KEY:Stalker Vigilante Talent ~ Foe Collision			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Stalker Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The stalker vigilante shoves one of his foes into another. When the stalker vigilante deals hidden strike damage with a melee attack, he can also deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the extra damage from hidden strike to an opponent adjacent to the first (even if the second opponent is out of his reach). Unlike normal, this vigilante talent applies to any successful hidden strike.
Hide in Plain Sight	KEY:Stalker Vigilante Talent ~ Hide in Plain Sight		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Stalker Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The stalker vigilante can vanish right before his foes’ eyes, even when being observed.

A stalker vigilante must be at least 8th level to choose this talent.
Leave an Opening*		KEY:Stalker Vigilante Talent ~ Leave an Opening			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Stalker Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The stalker vigilante’s hidden strike leaves an unbalancing opening in a foe’s defenses, setting himself up to attack again. At the beginning of the foe’s next turn, if the stalker vigilante threatens the foe, the foe provokes an attack of opportunity from the stalker vigilante. Multiple attacks against the same foe do not create multiple attacks of opportunity in the same round (but attacks against several foes can cause each to provoke one attack of opportunity).
Mighty Ambush*		KEY:Stalker Vigilante Talent ~ Mighty Ambush			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Stalker Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The stalker vigilante can instantly knock out an opponent whom he gets the drop on. Once per round when he makes a successful hidden strike, he can instantly drop the damaged enemy unconscious for 1d4 rounds (Fort negates, DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante’s level + the higher of the vigilante’s Strength and Dexterity modifiers). Whether or not a creature successfully saves against this ability, it can’t be affected by that stalker vigilante’s mighty ambush again for 24 hours. A stalker vigilante must be at least 10th level to choose this talent.
Mockingbird			KEY:Stalker Vigilante Talent ~ Mockingbird			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Stalker Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The stalker vigilante can mimic almost any sort of voice, or even animal calls and sound effects, and he can throw his voice at a distance. This functions similarly to a combination of the ghost sound, ventriloquism, and vocal alteration (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 248) spells. A stalker must be at least 4th level to choose this talent.
Perfect Fall		KEY:Stalker Vigilante Talent ~ Perfect Fall			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Stalker Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As long as there is a wall or other surface within arm’s reach, a stalker vigilante never suffers falling damage. Even if no surface is available, he suffers only half damage from falling and lands on his feet.
Perfect Vulnerability	KEY:Stalker Vigilante Talent ~ Perfect Vulnerability		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Stalker Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a standard action, the stalker vigilante can attack his foe where that foe is weakest. This attack targets the foe’s touch AC, and the foe is denied her Dexterity bonus against the attack.

DESC:As a full-round action, the stalker vigilante can move up to his speed towards an opponent who is unaware of his presence (or who considers him an ally) and make a single attack against that opponent. If the attack hits, he can attempt a drag combat maneuver check (Advanced Player’s Guide 321) against that enemy with a +4 bonus and without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the drag succeeds, the stalker vigilante doesn’t need to have enough movement speed remaining in order to move with the enemy.

DESC:If the stalker vigilante knocks an opponent unconscious, kills the opponent, or otherwise renders the opponent unable to act before the opponent’s first action in a combat, the stalker can roll a Stealth check with a –5 penalty.

Throat Jab*			KEY:Stalker Vigilante Talent ~ Throat Jab				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Stalker Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The stalker vigilante’s hidden strike jabs his opponent in the throat, preventing that opponent from speaking until the stalker vigilante’s next turn (if he uses this ability on the surprise round against a surprised target and also acts before the target in the first round of combat, it lasts until the vigilante’s next turn after the first time the target acts). This prevents the target from calling out for help, using spells with verbal components, or doing anything else that requires speaking. The target cannot be affected by that vigilante’s throat jab again for 24 hours. A stalker vigilante must be at least 4th level to choose this talent.
Twisting Fear		KEY:Stalker Vigilante Talent ~ Twisting Fear			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Stalker Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.

# Warlock
Class Skills	KEY:Warlock Vigilante ~ Class Skills		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:In addition to the standard class skills of the vigilante, the warlock vigilante also gains the following class skills: Fly (Dex), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Spellcraft (Cha), and Use Magic Device (Cha).
Arcane Training I	KEY:Warlock Vigilante ~ Arcane Training I		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Starting at 1st level, the warlock vigilante gains the ability to cast a limited number of spells. His spells are drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. A warlock vigilante must prepare his spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, his spells are not expended when they’re cast. Instead, he can cast any spell that he has prepared by consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming he hasn’t yet used up his spell slots per day for that level. To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the warlock vigilante must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell’s level. The saving throw DC against a warlock vigilante’s spell is 10 + the spell’s level + the warlock vigilante’s Intelligence modifier. A warlock vigilante starts out being able to cast only two 1st-level spells per day. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1–3 in the Core Rulebook). The warlock vigilante doesn’t automatically gain access to more spell levels as he goes up in level. Instead, he must select further arcane training talents if he wants to be able to cast higher-level spells. A warlock vigilante may know any number of spells, but the number he can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, he can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new vigilante level, the number of spells he can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1–2. Unlike the number of spells he can cast per day, the number of spells a warlock vigilante can prepare each day is not affected by his Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells a warlock can prepare. A warlock vigilante must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying his spellbook. While studying, the warlock vigilante decides what spells to prepare and refreshes his available spell slots for the day. Like a sorcerer, a warlock vigilante an choose to apply any metamagic feats he knows to a prepared spell as he casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, he may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats he knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. He cannot combine these options—a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting.
Spellbooks		KEY:Warlock Vigilante ~ Spellbooks			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A warlock vigilante must study his spellbook each day to prepare spells. He can’t prepare any spell not recorded in his spellbook, except for read magic (which all warlock vigilantes can prepare from memory). A warlock vigilante begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of his choice. He also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to his Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new vigilante level, he gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that he can cast (based on his new vigilante level) for his spellbook. At any time, a warlock vigilante can also add spells found in other spellbooks to his own (see Chapter 9 of the Core Rulebook).
Cantrips		KEY:Warlock Vigilante ~ Cantrips			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Warlock vigilantes can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells each day, as noted on Table 1–2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with his other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.

He makes this choice each time he activates Arcane Strike, and it lasts for the same duration. At 16th level he adds anarchic, axiomatic, f laming burst, icy burst, holy, shocking burst, and unholy to the list he can select from. He can choose to apply an alignment-based weapon special ability only if it matches the alignment of his vigilante identity.
Bombs				KEY:Warlock Vigilante Talent ~ Bombs				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warlock Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The warlock vigilante gains the alchemist’s bomb class feature (Advanced Player’s Guide 28). He can create a number of bombs per day equal to his Intelligence modifier + 1/2 his vigilante level. Since he doesn’t possess the throw anything alchemist class feature, he does not add his Intelligence to his damage rolls with his bombs. A warlock vigilante with this talent can use his further talents to select alchemist discoveries that modify bombs (discoveries with an asterisk [*]). He treats his vigilante level as his alchemist level for this purpose, and must meet all other prerequisites. If he also has levels in alchemist, his vigilante levels and alchemist levels stack for the purpose of determining bomb damage and meeting prerequisites for alchemist discoveries that modify bombs.
Bond of Blood		KEY:Warlock Vigilante Talent ~ Bond of Blood			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warlock Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The warlock vigilante has a magical bond to life-giving blood. When he deals 5 or more points of piercing or slashing damage to an adjacent living creature that has blood, he gains 1d6 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour, and he can’t gain temporary hit points again from bond of blood during that hour (even if he loses all the temporary hit points from bond of blood before that time). The number of temporary hit points gained increases by 1d6 for every 4 vigilante levels he possesses. At 6th level, the warlock vigilante can activate blood armor (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 176) once per day as a spell-like ability as a swift action.
Caster’s Defense		KEY:Warlock Vigilante Talent ~ Caster’s Defense			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warlock Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The warlock vigilante gains Combat Casting as a bonus feat. When he successfully casts defensively, he gains DR/magic equal to 1/2 his vigilante level for 1 round. He gains this benefit only if he is threatened by a creature that could have made an attack of opportunity against him had he failed the check. At 10th level, this DR also requires an alignment to overcome. The warlock vigilante must choose an alignment opposed to one alignment axis of his vigilante identity, and once he chooses an alignment, he can’t change it.
Concealed Casting		KEY:Warlock Vigilante Talent ~ Concealed Casting		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warlock Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:When the warlock vigilante casts a spell with a verbal or somatic component, he can attempt to conceal that component. Concealing a verbal component requires a Bluff check opposed by the targets’ Sense Motive checks, and concealing a somatic component requires a Sleight of Hand check opposed by the targets’ Perception checks. The warlock vigilante gains a +4 bonus on checks to conceal his verbal or somatic components. If he attempts to conceal both components for the same spell, he must make a check for each. If creatures are unaware of the warlock vigilante, he typically doesn’t need to make a Sleight of Hand check. Observers will suspect someone is nearby, but they pinpoint the warlock vigilante only if he fails at his Bluff check.
Educated Defense		KEY:Warlock Vigilante Talent ~ Educated Defense			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warlock Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:By analyzing a spell, a warlock vigilante can negate it or turn it back on its caster. If the warlock succeeds at a Spellcraft check to identify a spell that targets him (subject to the same restrictions as spell turning), he can spend an immediate action to negate that spell. He can negate a number of levels worth of spells per day equal to his vigilante level, and can’t attempt to negate a spell if his remaining number or levels of negation is less than the spell’s level. At 12th level, the warlock vigilante can ref lect the spell back on its caster (as spell turning) by spending one additional level of negation when he negates a spell. A warlock vigilante must be at least 6th level to select this talent.
Elemental Battle Armor	KEY:Warlock Vigilante Talent ~ Elemental Battle Armor		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warlock Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:When in his vigilante identity, the warlock vigilante gains armor made of elemental energy. He is surrounded by a nimbus of ice, lightning, or f lames, granting him resistance 5 to cold, electricity, or fire. The damage type must be chosen when he selects this talent, and it cannot be changed. At 4th level, a creature striking the warlock vigilante with a natural weapon or a non-reach handheld weapon takes 1d6 points of damage of the chosen energy type. A creature that attempts a grapple combat maneuver check against him also takes this damage. A creature can take damage in this way no more than once per round. At 8th level, the energy resistance increases to 10. At 12th level, the damage creatures take when grappling or striking the warlock vigilante increases to 2d6. At 16th level, the warlock vigilante becomes immune to the chosen damage type while in his vigilante identity.
Familiar			KEY:Warlock Vigilante Talent ~ Familiar				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warlock Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The warlock vigilante gains a familiar (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 82), using his vigilante level as his effective wizard level.
Living Shadow		KEY:Warlock Vigilante Talent ~ Living Shadow			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warlock Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Once per day, the warlock vigilante can become a living shadow as though he were using shadow body (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 186). This effect lasts for 1 round per vigilante level, and the warlock vigilante can’t cast spells while in this form. At 14th level, the warlock vigilante can remain as a living shadow for 1 minute per vigilante level instead, and can cast spells while he’s a living shadow. A warlock vigilante must be at least 6th level to select this talent.
Mystic Bolt			KEY:Warlock Vigilante Talent ~ Mystic Bolt			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warlock Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The warlock vigilante can deliver harmful magical attacks at will by shooting a ray or touching his foe. A melee mystic bolt requires a melee touch attack that doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity, and a ranged mystic bolt is a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet. A mystic bolt deals 1d6 points of damage, plus 1 point per vigilante level he possesses. When he selects this talent, the warlock vigilante must choose one type of damage for his mystic bolt: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Attacking with a mystic bolt takes the place of one of the warlock vigilante’s normal attacks, and he can make a full attack using mystic bolts. A warlock vigilante can select this talent multiple times. Each time, he can choose a new damage type he can use for his mystic bolts. Weapon Focus (ray) doesn’t apply to mystic bolts, but a warlock vigilante can take Weapon Focus (mystic bolts) and apply it to both melee and ranged mystic bolts. A warlock vigilante must be at least 4th level to select this talent.
Nonlethal Spellcasting	KEY:Warlock Vigilante Talent ~ Nonlethal Spellcasting		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warlock Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The warlock vigilante can cause his spells to deal nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. When he casts a spell that deals damage, he can declare it to be a nonlethal spell. If the spell deals typed damage, it’s still treated as that type (for immunities, weaknesses, and so on) but adds to the target’s nonlethal damage total instead of subtracting from its hit points. Creatures that are immune to nonlethal damage are immune to this damage. The warlock vigilante’s decision affects all targets of the spell; he can’t choose for some to take lethal damage and others to take nonlethal damage.
Shadow Jump			KEY:Warlock Vigilante Talent ~ Shadow Jump			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warlock Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The warlock vigilante gains the shadow jump ability with an effective shadowdancer level equal to his vigilante level – 6.

Signature Spell		KEY:Warlock Vigilante Talent ~ Signature Spell			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warlock Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The warlock vigilante becomes known for using a particular spell that becomes a symbol of his magical power. When he casts this spell, he gains a +4 bonus on concentration checks required to cast that spell and increases the DC of any saving throws it requires by 1. Whenever he gains a vigilante level, he can change the spell to which this talent applies.
Social Simulacrum		KEY:Warlock Vigilante Talent ~ Social Simulacrum		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warlock Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The warlock vigilante can create a short-lived simulacrum (as per lesser simulacrum on page 238 of Ultimate Magic) that duplicates his social identity, allowing him to appear to be in two places at once. Creating the duplicate takes 1 hour and requires no material component cost. It lasts for 4 hours before turning back into an inert pile of snow. The duplicate replicates only the warlock vigilante’s social identity, with the same alignment and abilities. It has no magical abilities, and can’t assume a vigilante identity. As with the spell, the simulacrum isn’t under the warlock vigilante’s control. The warlock vigilante can create a social simulacrum no more than once per day and can have only one in existence at a time. A warlock vigilante must be at least 8th level to select this talent.
Tattoo Chamber		KEY:Warlock Vigilante Talent ~ Tattoo Chamber			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warlock Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The warlock vigilante can magically absorb items through a runic tattoo on his hand or wrist and either easily retrieve them or activate their magical abilities without making them manifest. The items seemingly disappear into the tattoo, but actually enter an extradimensional space that the warlock vigilante can quickly access via the tattoo. Stowing an item in this way requires a full-round action, and the space can store one item plus one additional item per 3 vigilante levels he possesses. These items must be items the warlock vigilante can hold in one hand. Retrieving a stowed item requires mentally activating the tattoo as a swift action. The item appears in the vigilante’s hand, so if it’s a worn item he must still don it to benefit from it. The warlock vigilante can also activate any spell-trigger abilities of a stored item as though he were wielding the item, producing the magic effect from his tattoo rather than from the item. If the warlock vigilante dies while items are within his tattoo chamber, those items fade into existence within 5 feet of the corpse.

He can cast any spell he knows at any time without preparing it ahead of time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level. To learn or cast a spell, a zealot vigilante must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a zealot vigilante’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the zealot vigilante’s Charisma modifier. A zealot vigilante starts out being able to cast one 1st-level spell per day. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1–3 in the Core Rulebook). A zealot vigilante’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A zealot vigilante begins play knowing four 0-level spells and three 1st-level spells of his choice from the inquisitor spell list. At each new vigilante level, the number of spells the zealot vigilante knows each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1–3, though the zealot vigilante can’t know spells he can’t cast because he does not have the appropriate divine training talent. The zealot vigilante doesn’t automatically gain access to more spell levels as he goes up in level. Instead, he must select further divine training talents if he wants to be able to cast higher-level spells. Unlike the number of spells he can cast per day, the number of spells a zealot vigilante can prepare each day isn’t affected by his Charisma score. Like a sorcerer, a zealot vigilante can choose to apply any metamagic feats he knows to a prepared spell as he casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).

Once a neutral zealot vigilante makes this choice, it cannot be changed. A zealot vigilante must be 6th level before taking this talent.

Domain			KEY:Zealot Vigilante Talent ~ Domain				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Zealot Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Like a cleric’s deity, a zealot vigilante’s deity inf luences his alignment, what magic he can perform, and his values. Although not as tied to the tenets of the deity as a cleric, a zealot vigilante must still hold such guidelines in high regard, despite that fact he can go against them if it serves his crusade and goals. A zealot vigilante who takes this talent selects one domain from among those belonging to his deity. He can select an alignment domain only if his alignment matches that domain. Each domain grants a number of domain powers, depending on the level of the zealot vigilante. A zealot doesn’t gain the bonus spells listed for each domain, nor does he gain bonus spell slots. The zealot vigilante’s effective cleric level is equal to his vigilante level for determining the power and effect of his domain powers. If the zealot vigilante has cleric levels, one of his two domain selections must be the same domain selected for this talent. Levels of cleric and vigilante stack for the purpose of determining domain powers and abilities, but not for bonus spells.
Empower Symbol		KEY:Zealot Vigilante Talent ~ Empower Symbol			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Zealot Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a standard action, the zealot vigilante can empower his holy symbol. If the zealot is of good alignment, this works as if the holy symbol was the center of a consecration emanation. If the zealot is evil, it words as if the holy symbol was the center of a desecration emanation. If the zealot is neutral, he can choose whether this ability acts as per consecration or desecration, but once the choice is made, it cannot be changed. At 10th level, the zealot vigilante treats his holy symbol as a permanent fixture for the purpose of determining the concentration or desecration effects. A zealot vigilante must be at least 4th level to select this talent.
