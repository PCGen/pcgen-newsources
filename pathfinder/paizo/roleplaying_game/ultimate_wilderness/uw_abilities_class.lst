Weapon and Armor Proficiencies				KEY:Shifter ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiencies	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shifter Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																												DESC:A shifter is proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. She is also proficient with the natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) from the shifter claws class feature and of forms she assumes with wild shape. Shifters are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor. A shifter can wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as if it were steel. Shifters are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood. A shifter who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to use her shifter aspect, shifter claws, wild shape, and other shifter supernatural or spell-like abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.

Bonus Languages							KEY:Shifter ~ Bonus Languages				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shifter Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																												DESC:A shifter's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures, and Aklo, the tongue spoken by certain sinister fey or otherworldly denizens of reaches of the wild rarely explored by humanity. These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race. A shifter speaks Druidic, a secret language known only to druids and shifters, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level shifter. Druidic is a free language for a shifter; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages, and it doesn't take up a language slot. Shifters are forbidden to teach this language to non-druids or non-shifters.

Shifter Aspect							KEY:Shifter ~ Shifter Aspect				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shifter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																								DEFINE:ShifterAspectMinutes|0	DEFINE:ShifterAspectCount|0								DESC:At 1st level, a shifter gains her first aspect-a category of animal to which her body and soul have become supernaturally attuned. She can shift into her aspect's minor form for %1 minutes per day. The duration need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments. Shifting into a minor form is a swift action, while ending the effect is a free action that can be taken only on the shifter's turn. Until a shifter gains the chimeric aspect class feature, she can assume only one minor form at a time. Shifting to a new aspect (or aspects, in the case of chimeric aspects or greater chimeric aspects) ends all minor forms currently manifested. The minor forms of aspects are not polymorph effects, and the shifter does not lose the benefits of a minor form while affected by polymorph effects. As the shifter gains levels, she gains more aspects.|ShifterAspectMinutes																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Shifter Aspect Choice|ShifterAspectCount																							BONUS:VAR|ShifterAspectMinutes|ShifterLVL+3	BONUS:VAR|ShifterAspectCount|1+(ShifterLVL/5)																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.26	ASPECT:CheckType|Minutes per Day	ASPECT:CheckCount|%1|ShifterAspectMinutes	ASPECT:MasterAbility|Shifter Aspect

This magical transformation is fueled as much by the shifter's faith in the natural world as it is by inborn talent. The claws on each hand can be used as a primary natural attack, dealing 1d%1 points of piercing and slashing damage. If she uses one of her claw attacks in concert with a weapon held in the other hand, the claw acts as a secondary natural attack instead.

If the form she takes has claw attacks, she can use either the base damage of her shifter claws or the damage of the form's claws, whichever is greater. If the form does not have claw attacks, she can choose up to two natural attacks that would deal less damage than her shifter claw damage and have those attacks instead deal the same damage as her shifter claws.|PREVARGTEQ:ShifterWildShape,1																																																																										ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|Shifter Claw																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																BONUS:VAR|ShifterClawDamage|4|PRESIZEEQ:M	BONUS:VAR|ShifterClawDamage|3|PRESIZEEQ:S	BONUS:VAR|ShifterClawDamage|6|PRESIZEEQ:L	BONUS:VAR|ShifterClawDamage|1|PRESIZEEQ:S|PREVARGTEQ:ShifterLVL,7	BONUS:VAR|ShifterClawDamage|2|PRESIZEGTEQ:M|PREVARGTEQ:ShifterLVL,7	BONUS:VAR|ShifterClawDamage|2|PREVARGTEQ:ShifterLVL,11	BONUS:VAR|ShifterClawDamage|2|PREVARGTEQ:ShifterLVL,13	BONUS:VAR|ShifterClawSize|1|PREVARGTEQ:ShifterLVL,7	BONUS:VAR|ShifterClawSize|1|PREVARGTEQ:ShifterLVL,11	BONUS:VAR|ShifterClawSize|1|PREVARGTEQ:ShifterLVL,13	BONUS:WEAPONPROF=Shifter Claw|CRITMULTADD|1|PREVARGTEQ:ShifterLVL,17																							SOURCEPAGE:p.26
Wild Empathy							KEY:Shifter ~ Wild Empathy				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shifter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																									DESC:A shifter can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (Core Rulebook p93). The shifter rolls 1d20 and adds her shifter level and Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the shifter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another and under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. The shifter can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.

Woodland Stride							KEY:Shifter ~ Woodland Stride				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shifter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																									DESC:A shifter can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as briars, natural thorns, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Briars, thorns, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect the shifter.

This ability functions as beast shape II, except as noted here. The shifter can turn into the major form of only one of her aspects at a time. The effect lasts for %1 hours or until she changes back. Using wild shape to change to a major form or back is a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Often a particular aspect's major form grants abilities beyond the normal effect of beast shape II. Each major form details the abilities the shifter gains with that major form and at what level; she gains these instead of the form abilities from beast shape II, but she still gains beast shape II abilities that are size dependent. A shifter loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal of that form can make, but she can communicate with other animals of the same general grouping as her form. She can also communicate in nonverbal ways with allies. A shifters can take feats and other abilities that require wild shape; for the purpose of qualifying for prerequisites, her effective druid level is equal to her shifter level.|ShifterWildshapeCount|ShifterLVL																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						BONUS:VAR|ShifterWildShape|1	BONUS:VAR|ShifterWildshapeCount|min(8,((ShifterLVL-2)/2))																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.27
