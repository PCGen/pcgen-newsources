The target creature suffers 1d6 hit points/ level (maximum 10d6) and 1 point/2 levels of Charisma damage (maximum 5). Upon a successful save the target suffers only half the hit point damage and negates the Charisma damage.

Accelerate Decay				CLASSES:Druid,Ranger=3											SCHOOL:Transmutation																	TYPE:Divine			COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) creature																															DURATION:Instantaneous										SAVEINFO:Will Partial						SPELLRES:Yes							DESC:This spell only affects corporeal undead creatures and creatures kept artificially young through magic. This spell accelerates the creatures' rot back to where a body would be ruined. The damage to undead creatures and creatures that are kept artificially young through magic (such as a potion of youth) is (CASTERLEVEL)d6 points (to a maximum of 10d6). Particularly ancient creatures such as vampires take double damage. Mummies get +4 to their Will saves and take only half damage due to their initial preservation techniques when buried. Fast healing possessed by undead creatures is suppressed for 24 hours. If an undead creature is reduced to 0 hit points, it crumbles into a pile of dust. A successful save results in half damage and negates all other effects. &nl;The spell does not affect artificial constructs unless those constructs are made of corpses, like flesh golems. These creatures also get a Will save. If the construct is reduced to 0 hit points or less it falls apart and is destroyed.

Accursed Rot				CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=9							SCHOOL:Necromancy										DESCRIPTOR:Evil						TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M, DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:One creature																																	DURATION:Permanent/Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:None see text						SPELLRES:Yes							DESC:This spell infects both a powerful curse and a horrible rotting disease.

Acid Spit					CLASSES:Druid,Magus,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3							SCHOOL:Evocation										DESCRIPTOR:Acid						TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One creature																																	DURATION:3 rounds											SAVEINFO:Reflex partial						SPELLRES:Yes							DESC:When you cast this spell, you spit acid in the face of one creature, dealing (CASTERLEVEL)d6 points of damage per level (maximum 10d6). If the target has eyes and is not somehow protected, the spell also blinds the target. A successful saving throw reduces the damage by half and negates the blindness. On the second round, the spell deals half its original damage, and on the third round it deals half that again (the damage in the second and third rounds is further reduced if the target made its save). If a target of this spell spends a full round washing the affected area in water (or similar liquid) the spell (including blindness) will be negated.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.35-36
Adamantine Bonds				CLASSES:Druid,Summoner,Witch=6									SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation					DESCRIPTOR:Earth						TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:Any creature																																	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) days or until discharged						SAVEINFO:Reflex partial						SPELLRES:Yes							DESC:This spell causes a cord made of magically hardened adamantine to come into being and wrap around the target creature, immobilizing it, causing the creature to suffer the pinned condition. Creatures that make their saving throw gain the entangled condition instead. A pinned creature can always attempt to free itself, usually through a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check (DC equal to (10+(CASTERLEVEL)+PELLSTAT) plus your relevant caster ability modifier). Entangled creatures can attempt to break free as a move action, making a Strength or Escape Artist check. The DC for this check is equal to the DC of the spell. Once a creature breaks free, the spell is discharged. The bonds cannot be damaged, broken, ruined, or even disintegrated; they are considered an attended object and will even teleport with the victim. Another creature can aid another in breaking the bonds.

Adjust					CLASSES:Magus,Sorcerer,Summoner,Wizard=1								SCHOOL:Transmutation																	TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:One unattended suit of armor, set of clothing, jewelry, shield, or weapon																						DURATION:Instantaneous										SAVEINFO:None							SPELLRES:No								DESC:Adjust instantaneously resizes an unattended piece of clothing or jewelry, a suit of armor, a shield or a weapon to fit you perfectly. This spell affects both magical and mundane equipment.

Agony Unseen				CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=7										SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation													TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:Invisible cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high																										DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes								SAVEINFO:Fortitude partial see text				SPELLRES:No								DESC:An invisible bank of acidic and toxic gases billows out from the point you designate. Those exposed to the cloud suffer severe and painful blisters all over their bodies and inside their lungs, suffering wracking pains that impose a -4 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. In addition, the subject is nauseated and suffers 1d6 bleed damage each round. These effects last for 1 hour. A successful saving throw reduces the nauseated condition to sickened, reduces the bleed damage by half, and reduces the circumstance penalty to -2. Constructs, undead, and creatures immune to both poison and acid are immune to this spell. Creatures immune to only one of these effects, or resistant to both, receive only a +4 bonus to their saving throw. The wracking pains and conditions inflicted this spell can only be negated by a 6th level or higher conjuration (healing) spell. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the gases in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the gases in 1 round. The spell does not function underwater.

Aid Item					CLASSES:Bard,Druid,Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=6							SCHOOL:Transmutation																	TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:One magically enchanted item																														DURATION:1 hour											SAVEINFO:None							SPELLRES:No								DESC:This spell temporarily adds 3 special charges to a magic item. If 3 charges are used then one ability of the item is activated as an immediate action (if you don't know the item's abilities then one ability is activated at random), if 2 charges are used then one ability of the item is activated as a move action, if 1 charge is used then one ability of the item is activate as a standard action. These charges may be tapped into without drawing upon the item's normal reservoir of charges or uses per day. This buffer (and any unused charges) vanishes when the spell expires. It the item cannot be activated by at least a standard action this spell has no effect on that item.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.36
Aid Item (Greater)			CLASSES:Druid,Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=9								SCHOOL:Transmutation																	TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:One magically enchanted item																														DURATION:1 hour or until discharged								SAVEINFO:None							SPELLRES:No								DESC:This spell temporarily grants the item your caster level, and the DC of one of its effects becomes 20+ your relevant caster ability modifier. It also adds 3 special charges to a magic item. If 3 charges are used then one ability of the item is activated as an immediate action (if you don't know the item's abilities then one ability is activated at random), if 2 charges are used then one ability of the item is activated as a move action, and if 1 charge is used then one ability of the item is activated as a standard action. These charges may be tapped into without drawing upon the item's normal reservoir of charges or uses per day. This buffer (and any unused charges) vanishes when the spell expires or it is discharged. Once the item has been used three times the spell is discharged. If the item cannot be activated by at least a standard action this spell has no effect on that item.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.36-37
Air and Water				CLASSES:Bard,Druid,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=5							SCHOOL:Transmutation									DESCRIPTOR:Air|Water					TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Creature, object, or point in space touched																											DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hour (D)								SAVEINFO:Will negates see text				SPELLRES:See text							DESC:You create a 15-foot-radius emanation centered on the target, which can move if placed on a creature or a movable object. The emanation acts on both air and water, creating an area where the two mix in roughly equal portions. Water within the emanation becomes suffused with bubbles of air, creating an area where air-breathing creatures can breathe normally, while air within the emanation becomes a very wet mist where water-breathing creatures can breathe normally. The spell does not affect any contaminants that may be suspended in the affected air or water, such as poison gases, silt, or smoke. Likewise, the spell does not function in a vacuum, nor will it affect any magical liquid or any nonmagical liquid that is not at least 75 percent water. Underwater, the emanation creates an environment that functions partly as a land area and partly as a water area.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.37
Airsphere					CLASSES:Druid,Ranger=3											SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation													TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:30-foot-radius spread, Creature or object touched																										DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minute									SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)				SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)						DESC:This spell creates a sphere of fresh air around the individual or object touched by the caster. Gaseous and vaporous attacks are unable to penetrate this airsphere, and acids or other liquids simply wash over it. The spell generates oxygen, enabling you to breathe underwater or in other areas with no fresh air (though as the sphere surrounds its recipient or object, it hampers movement in or under water). This spell doesn't protect against natural or magical effects occurring within the airsphere: for example, if a vial of acid is thrown into the sphere, it enters; if it breaks, its contents splash for their normal effects. This spell was specially crafted to guard against dragon breath; it will absorb and negate any breath weapon (for those within the sphere) upon contact but is itself destroyed, instantly and harmlessly, in doing so.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.37
Alter Liquid				CLASSES:Bard,Druid,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1							SCHOOL:Transmutation									DESCRIPTOR:Water						TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:Up to 1 pint of nonmagical liquid/level (maximum 5 pints) individual volumes within 30 feet of each other																	DURATION:Instantaneous										SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)				SPELLRES:Yes (object)						DESC:This spell transmutes one kind of nonmagical liquid into another. The liquid you affect must normally be liquid at about room temperature (65degrees Farenhite), you must have line of effect to it, and you can alter liquids in open containers, but not in sealed containers. You can select multiple targets for this spell so long as the maximum volume is not exceeded, but you cannot select a target with a greater volume than your limit and partially affect it. For example, a 1st-level caster (1 pint maximum) could not affect any of the liquid in a full 1-gallon container. The spell can transmute any type of mundane liquid (including fresh or salt water, wine, vinegar, alcohol, or lamp oil) but cannot affect or create acid, mercury, or any type of venom or poison. Transmuted liquids created by the spell have typical characteristics such as color, taste, smell, and potency. For example, if you turn water to ale, you get typical ale rather than any extra-strong or distinctive variety.																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.37-38
Alter Metal					CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=5										SCHOOL:Transmutation									DESCRIPTOR:Earth						TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) lbs. of metal objects (maximum 20 lb.) all within 30 feet of each other																				DURATION:Instantaneous										SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)				SPELLRES:Yes (object)						DESC:This spell transmutes one kind of metal into another. The metal you affect (both in its original and transmuted forms) must be solid at room temperature (so that neither mercury nor molten iron can be altered, for example). You can select multiple targets for this spell so long as the maximum weight is not exceeded, but you cannot select a target with a greater weight than your limit and partially affect it. For example, a 9th-level caster (9 lb. maximum) could transmute 450 coins in a pile of 500, but could not affect 9 lb. of metal in a 10-lb. ingot. This spell can transmute any type of mundane metal or alloy (including brass, lead, bronze, iron, copper, and silver) but cannot affect or create gold, platinum, adamantine, mithral, alchemical silver, or cold iron. Weapons and armor become less effective if transmuted into softer metal (steel to copper, for example), with weapons taking a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls and armor losing 1 point of armor bonus. Weapons softened by this spell bend and gain the broken condition on any attack roll of 1. Armor changed by this spell loses an additional point of armor bonus every time it is struck by a natural attack roll of 20, upon reaching an armor bonus of zero it gains the broken condition. Unattended, nonmagical items receive no saving throw against this spell, while nonmagical items in a creature's possession use the wielder's Will save bonus. Magic items use their own Will save bonus or their wielder's, whichever is higher. Metal creatures and intelligent metal magic items are not affected by this spell. A successful Appraise or Spellcraft check (DC 15) reveals this spell's effect on an item.																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.38
Alter Poison Damage Type		CLASSES:Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1									SCHOOL:Transmutation																	TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One dose of non-magical poison that deals ability damage																									DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes								SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)				SPELLRES:Yes (object)						DESC:You are able to change the type of ability damage dealt by the affected poison. Poison that deals Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution damage may only be altered to one of the other two types. Poison that deals Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma damage may only be altered to one of the other two types. When the spell ends, the poison reverts to its normal damage type. A dose of poison under the effect of this spell is considered a magically modified poison.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.38
Alter Range					CLASSES:Inquisitor,Magus,Sorcerer,Wizard=4							SCHOOL:Transmutation																	TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Long					TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) ranged weapons or ((CASTERLEVEL)*50) missiles, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart																	DURATION:((CASTERLEVEL)*10) minutes								SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)				SPELLRES:Yes (object)						DESC:You can either enhance the range of ranged weapons by doubling their range increment, or reduce their range increment by one-half. Constructs are allowed a Will save to resist the effects of this spell on their built-in weapons, and other creatures are allowed a save to resist for weapons they carry.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.38
Alter Taste					CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=0								SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Glamer														TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:10 ft.				TARGETAREA:One meal of (CASTERLEVEL) cu. ft.																													DURATION:Instantaneous										SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)				SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)						DESC:This spell changes the taste of one meal to a taste that is pleasant for the creature consuming it. Note that this spell only disguises the taste of the meal and does not alter any other quality of it. While it will alter the taste of rotten meat, for instance, the meat will still be rotten. Furthermore, all parts of the meal taste the same no matter what is eaten. Thus soup, salad, main course, dinner roll and so on will all taste exactly alike since the spell masks any and all flavors with the taste. Each creature that tastes the meal will experience a different taste sensation depending on what his or her preference is. Thus, one creature might taste warm bread while another tastes raw meat. This spell changes the taste of anything that is part of the meal at the time the spell is cast; if something is added later, such as gravy or poison, then the spell cannot alter that and the creature receives the proper taste of the added item. Creatures are instantly aware of this spell's effect upon the first bite and can choose to disbelieve the spell's effects at any time.																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.38-39
Amber Globes				CLASSES:Druid=3|Magus,Sorcerer,Wizard=2								SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation					DESCRIPTOR:Electricity					TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:((CASTERLEVEL)/2) globe of electricity energy																											DURATION:((CASTERLEVEL)*10) minutes or until expended					SAVEINFO:None or Reflex half see text			SPELLRES:No								DESC:You create up to five globes of electricity energy about the size of acorns, which can be hurled at targets by you or another creature, or can be detonated on command. Each globe is capable of dealing 2d6 points of electricity damage; you can hurl them singly or as multiple attacks. Each globe is a splash weapon with a range increment of 30 feet that requires a ranged touch attack to hit. Throwing a single globe is an attack action (that can be made as part of casting the spell), while throwing all the globes at a single target is a standard action (or a full round action made as part of casting the spell). Globes not thrown during the round in which you cast the spell can be held for throwing in a subsequent round, or can be handed to other characters as a standard action. Each globe explodes upon striking any hard surface, and in addition to dealing its regular electricity damage to the target, deals 2 points of splash damage (also electricity damage) per globe in all adjacent squares. Creatures within the splash area that make a successful Reflex save take only half the splash damage, but creatures struck directly are not allowed a saving throw against the globe's primary damage. Alternatively, you can gently toss or place a globe within 5 feet of you so that it does not explode on contact. Once in place, you can cause one or more globes to detonate by speaking a command word as a standard action if you are within 200 feet. When it detonates, the globe deals its electricity damage to all targets within a 5-foot burst. Creatures in the area that make a successful Reflex save take only half damage.

Analyze Malady				CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=7								SCHOOL:Divination																		TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) object or creature																													DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)								SAVEINFO:None or Will negates see text			SPELLRES:No								DESC:You discern all curses, afflictions, and detrimental effects present in a number of creatures or objects. Each round, you may examine a single creature or object and learn, as a free action, how to dispel, remove or negate these effects. In the case of a magic item or artifact, you also learn how to destroy the object. In the case of an object or creature with active spells cast upon it, you learn each spell, its effect, and its caster level. An attended object may attempt a Will save to resist this effect if its holder so desires. If the save succeeds, you learn nothing about the object except what you can discern by looking at it. An object that makes its save cannot be affected by any other analyze malady spells for 24 hours.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.39
Anathema					CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=6										SCHOOL:Abjuration																		TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 round				RANGE:10 ft.				TARGETAREA:((CASTERLEVEL)*10) ft. radius emanation from caster																										DURATION:((CASTERLEVEL)*10) minutes								SAVEINFO:None							SPELLRES:Yes							DESC:The spell charges the area around you with arcane energy of a sort that the gods themselves find most unpleasant. This form of energy also interferes with the prayers of the faithful, making it more difficult for divine words of power to be invoked. Divine spellcasters within the area suffer a spell failure chance of 50 percent for any divine spells they cast while in this area. The spell has no further effect on divine spells that are successfully cast within the area, or on divine spells that were already cast before the caster entered the anathema area of effect.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.39
Anger of the Spirit			CLASSES:Druid,Witch=8											SCHOOL:Necromancy																		TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One living creature																															DURATION:Permanent										SAVEINFO:Will negates						SPELLRES:Yes							DESC:You call upon all the spirits of nature, wracking the target with a horrid fate. First, the target must roll twice for every initiative, attack, ability check, skill check, and saving throw, taking the lower of the two rolls. Second, the spirits torment him, causing an additional effect based on your choice: Roll twice for SR as well. Roll twice for damage each time the target hits, taking the lower damage total. Roll twice on all spell-related effects. Roll twice for all percentile rolls (miss chance, stabilization, fortification). Roll three times (rather than twice) for initiative. Target cannot refocus or delay. One special ability with a duration has its duration halved. Any positive effect of the special ability is halved, and any negative effect is doubled. Carrying capacity is halved. Decrease speed -5 ft. if wearing armor. Take double damage from all energy attacks. This spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by a remove curse, limited wish, miracle or wish. A remove curse or limited wish only grants a second saving throw; if that save is unsuccessful, those spells have no further effect.																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.39-40
Angry Wound					CLASSES:Alchemist,Cleric,Inquisitor,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2					SCHOOL:Necromancy										DESCRIPTOR:Evil						TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Living creature touched																															DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D) see text						SAVEINFO:See text							SPELLRES:Yes							DESC:Upon concluding the dreadful incantation, you become fueled with awful power; your touch causes flesh to burst and weep freely. With a touch, you open an ugly wound on a living creature, dealing 1d6 points of damage (no save). Each round thereafter, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or take an additional 1d6 points of damage as its flesh bursts and suppurates. If the target succeeds on two consecutive saves, the effect ends.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Animal Mind					CLASSES:Bard,Druid,Ranger=3|Cleric,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4					SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion|Mind-Affecting											TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One creature with Intelligence 2 or greater																											DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours									SAVEINFO:Will negates						SPELLRES:Yes							DESC:Choose an animal type when you cast this spell. The subject believes it is an animal of that type. If the subject does not know how such an animal would act, it acts in a manner that it believes an animal should act. While affected by this spell, spells and abilities that target animals will also affect the subject. Any attempt to interact with the subject requires a Handle Animal check DC (10+(CASTERLEVEL)).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Animate Element				CLASSES:Druid,Summoner=1										SCHOOL:Transmutation																	TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 round				RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One small volume of an element																														DURATION:Concentration, up to (CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)				SAVEINFO:None							SPELLRES:No								DESC:The caster animates a small section of air, earth, fire, or water. The animated element has the statistics of a Small elemental (see Pathfinder BestiaryTM), and attacks as directed by the caster. It cannot move beyond the range of the spell.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Animate Skeleton				CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=1									SCHOOL:Necromancy																		TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:One corpse or skeleton																															DURATION:Instantaneous										SAVEINFO:None							SPELLRES:No								DESC:This spell turns the body or bones of a person or creature into a skeleton. This spell will only animate dead creatures of Medium size or smaller. The skeleton can follow the caster and obey the caster's commands or can remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific type of creature) entering the place. The skeleton remains animated until it is destroyed. A destroyed skeleton cannot be reanimated again. Regardless of the number of times this spell is cast, only a single skeleton from this spell may be controlled at any one time by a single caster. If another skeleton is animated using this spell while another is already under your control, the original becomes uncontrolled. This undead does not count against your HD limit of controlled undead. An undead skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton or corpse. If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Animate Tattoo				CLASSES:Alchemist,Bard,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1							SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Shadow														TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 hour				RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:A 3-inch-square area of flesh																														DURATION:Permanent										SAVEINFO:See text							SPELLRES:See text							DESC:You create a tattoo upon your own body that has the ability to move and attack (using your base attack bonus plus the relevant casting ability modifier) out to a range equal to your natural reach. Moving the tattoo around your body is not an action. Attacking with the tattoo is a melee attack action (it can be used to make attacks of opportunity). The tattoo deals damage equal to 1d6 plus the relevant casting ability modifier (successfully disbelieving after interacting with the tattoo reduces the damage by half). The spell can create an animated tattoo of a lion roaring or a dragon breathing fire, a moving waterfall, or a warrior swinging a sword. The image and its movements are preset; once the spell is cast, you cannot change them. The tattoo can move all over your body if you wish.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Animate Tools				CLASSES:Bard,Cleric,Druid,Sorcerer,Summoner,Witch,Wizard=0					SCHOOL:Transmutation																	TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:10 minutes			RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One tool or one set of related tools																													DURATION:8 hours											SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless, object) Spell		SPELLRES:Yes (harmless, object)				DESC:The spell causes a tool or a group of tools used together to perform a task to animate and perform a task you designate. These tools follow your directions to the best of their abilities, but can only be used for their intended purpose. This spell allows you to complete an amount of work equivalent to a single person working for eight hours. The tools use your Craft or Profession check as appropriate. The tools may aid another. There are many other common uses of this spell that require no check, such as commanding a broom to sweep the floor or a shovel to dig a trench. Only mundane tasks can be accomplished with this spell. It has no effect on crafting magic items. Under no circumstance can tools be used to attack a creature, though items can damage a structure if that is their intended purpose (such as a pick or an axe).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.40-41
Animate Wood				CLASSES:Druid=1												SCHOOL:Transmutation																	TYPE:Divine			COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 round				RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One Small or smaller wooden object																													DURATION:Concentration, up to (CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)				SAVEINFO:None							SPELLRES:No								DESC:This spell imbues a Small or smaller wooden object as an animated object (see Pathfinder BestiaryTM), then causes it to immediately attack whomever or whatever you initially designate. Objects animated by this spell have hardness 5. If you attempt to affect an attended object, the object or its attendee receives a Will save and spell resistance applies.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Antagonize Wound				CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=0							SCHOOL:Necromancy																		TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Living creature touched																															DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D) see text						SAVEINFO:Fort negates						SPELLRES:Yes							DESC:With a touch, you cause an existing wound to deal 1 point of damage. Each round thereafter, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or take an additional 1 point of damage.

On your command, the tree pulls back its branches and fires a volley of acorns, branches, or other debris at any target that you designate. The tree receives one ranged attack per round and its BAB equals ((CASTERLEVEL)+DEX) modifier. Its attack deals 1d4+((CASTERLEVEL)/3) points of damage and has a range increment of 30 feet. The tree is immobile, has an AC of 16, and30 hit points. The tree is incapable of defending itself; it only attacks when directed. The spell ends two rounds after you cease concentration or the tree sustains 30 or more points of damage.

The air seems to crackle slightly, the way it does just before a major storm, and everything within the barrier appears to glitter as if coated with gold dust. Spellcasters within the area suffer a spell failure chance of 50 percent for any arcane spells they cast while in this area. The spell has no further effect on arcane spells that are successfully cast within the area, or on arcane spells that were already cast before the caster entered the arcane prohibition area of effect.

Arcane Seal (Lesser/Acid)		CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=2										SCHOOL:Abjuration																		TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 minute				RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:One magic seal placed on an object																													DURATION:Permanent until discharged (D)							SAVEINFO:None or Reflex half					SPELLRES:Yes							DESC:You create a magical seal that bears your visible arcane mark (and though you do not have to cast arcane mark to cast lesser arcane seal, it must be a spell you know). The seal you create resembles the wax seal one sees on letters and documents, and can range from 1 to 6 inches across. A lesser arcane seal is exceedingly tough, having a hardness of 10, 30 hit points, and a break DC of 25. When placed on a door or other closure (a chest, window, and so forth), the lesser arcane seal grants the portal its break DC or adds +5 to the portal's existing break DC (whichever is higher). The seal is unaffected by knock spells unless the caster makes a caster level check DC (12+(CASTERLEVEL)). A rogue or other character with the trapfinding class feature can break the seal with a DC 27 Disable Device check. At your option, you can also imbue the seal with magical energy so that any creature breaking it takes1d8 points, plus ((CASTERLEVEL),5) of acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. When you add a damaging effect to the seal, you must add additional runes to the seal. Anyone can read these runes and discover the seal's effect with a DC 12 Spellcraft check. You can disable a lesser arcane seal simply by touching it and using a standard action to dismiss the spell. At the time you create the seal, you can specify a password or phrase that allows other creatures to break the seal with no difficulty, and without triggering any damaging effects. Acid: A lesser acid seal leaves a patch of acid on the victim if it fails a Reflex save, dealing 1 point of continuing acid damage each round for 1d4 rounds. The affected creature can make another Reflex save as a full-round action to neutralize the acid (assuming no other means to do so is available).

She sheds bright light to a radius of 30 feet and shadowy light an additional 30 feet beyond that. Looking directly at the target creature is difficult, granting concealment to the target (20 percent miss chance) and dazzling anybody who looks directly at the target for 1d6 rounds (Will negates). If a creature looks at the target more than once, she will be re-dazzled. The durations of the dazzle effects do not stack but are renewed whenever the creature becomes re-dazzled. The armor of light also provides a +(((CASTERLEVEL)/4),5) deflection bonus to AC.

Creatures striking you with natural weapons or hand-held weapons take 7 points of piercing damage each time they hit you. In addition, the thorns grant the caster a +4 natural armor bonus. The caster may will the thorns to move out of the way so he may safely receive beneficial touch-based spells and spell-like effects. As a full-round action (does not provoke attacks of opportunity), the caster can have the vines strike out from his body, dealing 4d4 points of damage to all creatures within a 5-foot-long, 180-degree arc in front of him, or to all creatures within 5 feet of him (Reflex save for half damage).

Creatures striking you with natural weapons or hand-held weapons take 2d12 points of piercing damage each time they hit you. Once per round you make a grapple check ((CASTERLEVEL)+BASESPELLSTAT) against such an attacker; while grappled, that creature suffers this damage each round. In addition, the thorns grant the caster a +8 natural armor bonus. The caster may will the thorny vines to move out of the way so he may safely receive beneficial touch-based spells and spell-like effects. As a full-round action (which does not provoke attacks of opportunity), the caster can have the vines strike out from his body, dealing 4d12 points of damage to all creatures within a 15-foot-long, 180-degree arc in front of him, or to all creatures within 10 feet of him (Reflex save for half damage).

The metal plates are the material focus of the spell, and grant both a +5 armor bonus and damage reduction 5/adamantine. Due to the nature of the metal actually merging with the caster's skin, no armor check penalties or the like are inflicted by the temporary armor. After the duration of the spell has expired, the armor plates simply drop off. This is a common spell amongst the priesthood of mechanist sects.

If this spell would raise the target's base attack bonus to 21 or more, it receives a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, but gains no benefit for having a base attack bonus higher than +20. You don't possess this additional base attack bonus for the purpose of prerequisites.

Augment Poison				CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Ranger,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2						SCHOOL:Transmutation																	TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:((CASTERLEVEL)/3) non-magical poison doses																												DURATION:((CASTERLEVEL)*10) minutes								SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless, object) Spell		SPELLRES:yes (harmless, object)				DESC:This spell makes poison more potent and toxic. Any dose of poison affected by the spell has its Fortitude DC changed to (10+((CASTERLEVEL)/2)+BASESPELLSTAT). Furthermore, any ability damage caused by the poison does one additional point of damage each round and its duration is increased by 1 round. For example, if you had one dose of standard wyvern poison; injury; save DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Constitution damage; cure 2 consecutive saves; and it were augmented by a 11th-level wizard with a Intelligence score of 22, it would become augmented wyvern poison injury; save DC 21; frequency 1/round for 7 rounds; effect 1d4+1 Constitution damage; cure 2 consecutive saves; If the duration of the spell expires, the augmented effect ends immediately. Thus, if a person has suffered 6 rounds of the augmented wyvern poison and the spell ends before the 7th round it would not deal damage on the seventh round. This spell only affects discrete doses of poison, though they may already be placed on a weapon, trap, or other item. Thus, if the spell were cast on a 10-gallon vat of wyvern poison, it would have no effect. A dose of poison under the effect of this spell is considered a magically modified poison and does radiate magic.

Creatures within the area who fail their save cannot take any offensive action. If attacked, they will defend themselves with the total defense maneuver. Creatures who make their save suffer a -2 circumstance penalty on all attack and damage rolls. Casting spells of a destructive nature from within the area requires a Concentration check DC (10+(CASTERLEVEL)+BASESPELLSTAT).

You can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can't move closer to you than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent's move, the opponent and the obstacle each take damage as though struck by a club sized for your opponent (1d6 points of damage for a Medium creature), and the opponent stops in the space adjacent to the obstacle.

The subject can only make one successful awesome strike per round, the subject can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can't move closer to the subject than the square it started in.

As long as the snakes remain within sight, you can direct their actions telepathically as a free action. Each time you cast this spell you can create a number of snakes equal to (CASTERLEVEL). More powerful snakes take up more than one of your available total, as noted below. Snake statistics can be found in the Pathfinder BestiaryTM; details on the advanced and giant simple templates can be found within that book as well. Venomous Snake. Counts as 1 snake.

You magically bind a curse (a spell that cannot be dispelled, such as bestow curse) to the object touched. An unwilling creature attending an object you wish to affect with this spell receives a Will save to negate this spell. When a creature is considered to be attending the object (touching it or carrying on one's person) that creature is subject to the curse. Baleful object attempts to dispel (as described in greater dispel magic) any and all spells, spell-like abilities or effects on the target that directly or indirectly interfere with the curse taking effect. For example, a character casts bestow curse onto a longsword and a subject with spell immunity (bestow curse) upon her touches the object. A dispel check is made (DC 11 + the caster level of the spell immunity). If the dispel succeeds, the spell is dispelled before the bestow curse takes effect. Baleful object's dispelling can only affect spells cast upon a creature or object. Independent spell effects or those affecting an area cannot be dispelled, even if they prevent the curse from affecting the attending creature. Baleful object can dispel spells and magic items specifically intended to foil the spell in question (spell immunity), that provide general protection from spells (spell resistance), and/or offer any bonuses to the saving throws (cloak of resistance). You make a check for each instance of protection; a magic item so affected is suppressed for 1d4+1 rounds. You are not affected by the cursed object when you cast the spell but any time you touch or attend the object after the initial casting, you are affected as normal.

The gem continues to store this energy until activated or dispelled; there is no time limit. As long as the gem remains prepared, one 8th level spell slot is unavailable to the caster. Dispelling the gem's charge has no effect on the gem and returns the spell slot (empty) to the caster. When the gem is activated (a standard action that requires only that the gem be in hand), it is destroyed, crumbling to powder. However, an area of pure magic surrounds the caster and suppresses any antimagic effects that overlap the emanation. The emanation lasts for one round per (CASTERLEVEL).

You create one sting for every three caster levels (minimum 1, maximum 6 at 18th level). Each bee sting inflicts 1 point of piercing damage, as if from a magical weapon for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. If this damage is not somehow negated (such as by damage reduction), the subject is poisoned with weak venom that inflicts 1 Con damage, with a Fortitude save allowed at the spell's DC to negate it.

The GM offers a complete and perfectly accurate answer that is in no way cryptic, but if the subject is not related to the original query, the GM is not required to reveal that information. If the caster's player ever reveals any of the details of this insight to another player, or if the caster ever reveals any of the details of this insight to another character (PC or NPC-subject to GM adjudication), the caster is destroyed as if never having existing and reality is altered so that the information relayed is in some way vitally inaccurate and the truth is far more deadly and dangerous.

They can climb to the top of the building, descend into the bowels of a cellar, or shoot arrows from the porch or whatever they choose, as long as they do not leave the site. If they are forcibly removed from the site they make every effort to return to the site as soon as possible, by the fastest means possible. The spell will even hold a group to the location if the place is ruined, sinks, or has been disintegrated. The spell only ends if the spell focus is broken, ruined, dispelled or the focus is taken beyond the range of the spell.

The wine becomes any of the ingested poisons listed in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game; you cannot transform wine into a contact, inhaled or injury poison. Thus, although you could transform wine into the equivalent of "lich dust" (save Fortitude DC 17; onset 10 minutes; frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes; effect 1d3 Strength damage; cure 2 consecutive saves), you could not transform it into the equivalent of wyvern poison.

Creatures caught within the globe are nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds and take 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 25d6). Half this damage is cold damage and half is negative energy damage, with a successful Reflex save resulting in the creature being sickened for 1 round and reducing the damage by half. Undead creatures in the area of effect ignore cold damage from this spell and are not nauseated or sickened, even as the negative energy heals them of 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 12d6). Blackburst dispels any light spells of lower than 9th level within its area.

Anyone looking through the area of a blackout with darkvision cannot see into or past the area of this spell.

Black Blizzard				CLASSES:Cleric,Druid=9											SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Summoning													TYPE:Divine			COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 round				RANGE:Long					TARGETAREA:Cylinder (180-ft. radius, 50 ft. high)																												DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds									SAVEINFO:See text							SPELLRES:Yes							DESC:You conjure an immense and extremely violent sand storm. The storm obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20 percent miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50 percent miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target). Perception checks suffer a -8 penalty. Ranged weapons, other than siege weapons, are impossible to operate; siege weapons suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls. Movement through the area is considered difficult terrain even for flying creatures; each square counts as 2 squares of movement. The swirling sands and debris deal 8d6 bludgeoning damage +1 point per caster level to all creatures in the area and knock them prone. A successful Fortitude save halves the bludgeoning damage and negates being knocked prone. Flying creatures are forced to the ground by the powerful downdraft and take damage as if they fell unless they make a successful Fly check (DC 10 + your caster level + your relevant caster ability modifier), in which case they remain at their original altitude. Creatures that are knocked prone are buried beneath the sand. Buried creatures are protected from the swirling sands above but take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from the sand's weight per minute spent under the sand. If rendered unconscious, the victim must make a Constitution check (DC 15 + 1 per previous check) each minute or suffer 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead. In addition to the aforementioned physical damage, a buried creature also lacks breathable air and immediately starts suffocating. A buried creature can free itself by making a DC 15 Strength check. The DC increases by +2 for each previous failed check. Creatures that aren't buried can dig out their friends in 1 round; however, precisely locating a creature buried beneath the sand requires a DC 25 Perception check.

Blades of Jade				CLASSES:Druid=6												SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation													TYPE:Divine			COMPS:S, M		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:30 ft. radius																																DURATION:((CASTERLEVEL)*10) minutes								SAVEINFO:Reflex special						SPELLRES:No								DESC:You conjure green leaves, petals and blades of grass with the sturdiness of steel and a razor-sharp edge. Plants in the area also take on this form; they are unharmed and return to normal after the spell ends. Inspection is unlikely to reveal the altered nature of the plants (Perception DC 15 + your caster level + your relevant caster ability modifier), though success reveals a tiny metallic jingling of the clashing leaves or blades of grass. The area is considered difficult terrain and creatures passing through the area must make a successful Reflex save or suffer 3d6 points of slashing and piercing damage for every 5 ft. traversed in addition to injury to the feet and legs (Staggered for 24 hours, a successful Heal check [DC equal to spell's DC] negates this condition). A victim in the area of effect at the time of casting suffers 6d6 points of damage in addition to the potential penalties of moving through the area. Plants affected or created by blades of jade are immune to other spells altering plant growth, movement, or maturity such as, entangle or plant growth, and any plants already under the effects of such spells can't be affected by blades of jade.

A target must make a save for each facial feature; failure removes one set of features. Note that permanently removing the victim's features causes various adverse effects. Remove curse does not remove blank face.

By infecting the target with a minute amount of negative energy, this spell accelerates injuries to living tissue and makes wounds more serious. Even a small knife wound can be made to bleed more heavily, the flesh around it turning septic as the spell works its dark magic. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike your target. A creature struck by this ray takes an additional 1d6 damage every time it takes damage from any weapon or non-energy damage source (so not from spells that deal energy damage, or breath weapons) for the duration of the spell. This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, plants or oozes.

A night-black flame begins to burn on the victim's body. If the victim fails a Fortitude save, it suffers 4 points Constitution drain. The opponent must continue to save every round for the next 4 rounds (5 rounds total) to avoid being drained of an additional 4 points of Constitution per round. The caster gains 10 temporary hit points whenever it drains 4 points of Constitution. These temporary hit points last a maximum of 1 hour. If the victim is slain by blightfire ray, only icy fragments of the victim remain.

Once created, the cloud is stationary. This spell functions like obscuring mist except that fire spells do not burn off the mist. Water- and cold-based spells such as cone of cold or sleet storm will clear out the smoke and ash, however. Anyone within the cloud takes 2d6 fire damage each round. Affect- ed creatures may attempt a Reflex save for half damage. Spell resistance applies normally to the fire damage. This spell does not function underwater.

If the hole is opened directly below a creature, the creature is smashed into the hole, taking 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage from the block and 1d6 for every 10 feet it forces the creature to fall. Only creatures directly above the pit risk falling in. Creatures are buried by the stone block at the bottom of the pit; it takes 1 minute to uncover a creature buried at the bottom of the pit; a buried creature can free itself with a successful Strength Check DC 19. Any creature standing in the area where you first conjured the pit must make a Reflex saving throw to move to safely to the nearest open space (this does not provoke an attack of opportunity) but it still suffers the damage from being struck by the stone block as it leaves the area. In addition, the edges of the pit are sloped, and any creature ending its turn on a square adjacent to the pit must make a Reflex saving throw, with a +2 bonus, to avoid falling into it. At any point during the duration of the spell other targets may be forced into this pit by means such as a bull rush. Those creatures do not receive a saving throw. The pit's smooth, greased, stone walls have a Climb DC of 30 and a climber must make a successful Reflex save each round or be forced to move at half his climbing rate. Once the spell ends, the pit and the block disappear and the creature is deposited harmlessly on the surface.

The initial damage of this spell is 4d6 hit points and 2 points of Constitution damage. A successful save reduces the hit point damage by half and negates the ability damage. This spell only works on creatures that have blood to crystallize.

A target under the effects of this spell suffers double damage from all slashing or piercing attacks and double damage from bleed effects (such as those suffered by a dying character). This increased damage stacks with any damage done by a critical hit. This spell does not affect creatures with the construct, elemental, plant, ooze, or undead creature type. The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell.

You can create one creature for every four levels (so, a 20th level cleric could spawn five of these creatures). Each blood protector created costs one hit point's worth of shed blood. Blood protectors appear humanoid but have no distinct features; their bodies are clearly composed of fresh blood, somehow held together in largely solid form. The warriors appear to have armor molded to them, and each one wields a shield and either a short spear or short sword (your choice) with a +5 enhancement bonus. These warriors count as constructs. They do not have names, personalities, or any sense of self, but can follow simple orders. After the spell fades, or if they are destroyed, they revert to drops of blood.

The target creature suffers 2 points of Constitution damage and 4d6 fire damage per round. A heal spell cast during this time saves the creature's life, healing the damage and negating the spell.

An affected creature suffers excruciating pain, taking an immediate 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). In addition, it moves at half its normal speed and it takes a -4 circumstance penalty on Dexterity as its limbs stiffen. At the same time, the creature's skin hardens and becomes more resilient, improving its natural armor bonus by +2. (A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.) As well, the creature is no longer subject to critical hits and sneak attacks (or other effects that depend on having a discernable anatomy), since its vital organs are effectively shielded by the thickening blood. A successful Fortitude saving throw halves the damage and prevents all other effects (even those that could be beneficial). Blood to sap can target only living creatures with a discernable anatomy and a bloodstream. Constructs, elementals, oozes, plants, and undead (except those with the blood drain ability) are immune to the effects of this spell.

At the druid's option, these plants can be flowers or normal undergrowth such as grass and weeds. Blossoming footsteps only functions in rounds when the druid moves. The plants do not hinder movement or provide cover on their own, nor does their growth damage the surface where they grow. They can, however, be targeted by spells such as entangle or plant growth. When the spell's duration expires, the plants either continue to live normally if the ground is suitable, or else melt away.

Boiling Sea					CLASSES:Druid=9												SCHOOL:Transmutation									DESCRIPTOR:Earth|Fire|Water				TYPE:Divine			COMPS:V, S, M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Long					TARGETAREA:Water in a volume of ((CASTERLEVEL)*10) ft. by ((CASTERLEVEL)*10) ft./level by ((CASTERLEVEL)*2) ft., or one geyser of super-heated water filling a 5 ft. square and spraying upward ((CASTERLEVEL)*10) ft.	DURATION:((CASTERLEVEL)*10) minutes (D)							SAVEINFO:See text							SPELLRES:No								DESC:This spell has two different applications, both of which control water in different ways. The first version of this spell causes water in the area to swiftly superheat to the point of boiling. The second version causes water to surge from superheated seas deep beneath the earth to rise up, and create as massive geyser. Boiling sea deals 1d6 points of fire damage per round of exposure (no save). If a creature is fully immersed it deals 10d6 points of fire damage per round of exposure (no save). In addition, those wearing metal armor are affected as if by a heat metal spell (no save). Breathing air within the range of the boiling sea spell deals 1d6 points of fire damage per minute (no save). In addition, a character must make a Fortitude save every 5 minutes (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. Those wearing heavy clothing or any sort of armor take a -4 penalty on their saves. Geyser. Any creature entering the geyser, or occupying the square it appears in, must make a Reflex saving throw to avoid being hurled into the air and then falling to the ground. If the creature fails its saving throw, it takes 10d6 points of damage (half bludgeoning, half fire) from the super-heated water and also takes falling damage based upon the height of the geyser (e.g., if the geyser is 130 feet tall, the creature takes 13d6 falling damage), landing prone in a random square adjacent to the vent. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the falling damage, and the creature is moved to the closest square adjacent to the geyser (Large-sized or larger creatures are moved enough so that they are not on top of the geyser but still adjacent to it). In addition, the geyser sprays superheated water in a hemispherical emanation around its square. The radius of this emanation is equal to one-half the geyser's height (e.g., a 130-foot geyser has a 65-foot-radius emanation). Any creature within this area, including you, takes 2d6 points of fire damage each round as scalding water cascades on them. You can choose to make a smaller geyser than your level permits if an obstruction prevents it from reaching its full height, or if you simply want to create a spread of superheated rain that's smaller than what would be created by a full-height boiling sea spell.

Living creatures within the dark cloud take 3d6 points of cold damage each round they are inside the cloud. Those within the cloud are also staggered. A successful Fortitude save negates the staggered condition, but even with a successful save, being inside the cloud still causes 1d6 points of cold damage each round. Once cast, the spellcaster can shift the position of the bone chill cloud by 10 feet per round; however, the caster can take no other actions while moving the cloud.

This eruption inflicts 1d6 points of damage to the subject. If the creature survives, it can then use the spikes as weapons for the duration of the spell. The spikes add +1 point of damage to any grapple, natural, or unarmed attacks the subject makes.

This may manifest as rudeness, boorishness or complete disinterest depending on the subject's attitudes before being affected by the spell. Creatures with a Charisma of 1 cannot cast spells as a sorcerer or bard does; if the creature is subject to damage or another penalty that would reduce its Charisma below 1, the spell ends.

Borrow Limb					CLASSES:Alchemist,Cleric,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4						SCHOOL:Necromancy																		TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 round				RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																																		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours (D)																										DESC:You attach the severed forelimb of another creature to your torso, using it as an additional off-hand. You can use it to make an additional attack in a full-attack action, albeit at a -6 off-hand penalty (reduced to -3 if you have the Two- Weapon Fighting feat). You can also use it to wield a shield at no penalty (you can wield only one shield at a time). Additionally, you can hold objects or weapons in two hands and still cast spells with somatic components. When the spell ends, the limb falls off painfully, dealing 1d3 points of damage and impeding your concentration. You also can use this spell to attach a limb to the stump of one of your limbs that has been severed. In this case, the spell's duration changes to Instantaneous, and you may gain some special property of the limb if it has any (a troll's arm might regenerate, for instance, or a gargoyle's stony arm might function as a shield). The GM may shorten the duration if the limb has special properties (to 1 minute/ level or even (CASTERLEVEL) rounds). If the limb is from a living creature that was not offered freely, the spell gains the Evil descriptor.

You may touch a target creature to borrow the ranks it has in any one skill. On your next action, you can make a single skill check using the subject's ranks, but modified by your own key ability. If a skill check requires more than 1 round to make, you may not use this spell to borrow that skill.

Bouncing Boom				CLASSES:Summoner=5|Sorcerer,Wizard=6								SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation													TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One bouncing ball that moves each round, exploding in a 20-foot radius burst																						DURATION:5 rounds											SAVEINFO:Reflex half						SPELLRES:Yes							DESC:You create a coruscating ball of swirling multicolored energy that drops from above and lands where directed, only to bounce back into the air. Each round, bouncing boom drops to the surface, then bounces up again. When it lands each round, it deals 5d6 damage of a different energy type to all creatures in a 20-foot-radius burst. You can select any one of the standard five energy types but you must select a different energy type each round, and you cannot repeat an energy type for the duration of the spell. After the first round (where you determine the point where the ball drops), determine the ball's bouncing direction; you can have it land anywhere along that straight path up to 30 feet before it detonates again (it must move a minimum of 5 feet). If the ball hits an obstruction, such as a wall, tree, or person, it detonates there and then moves along a 5-foot path, though after detonating there it can bounce and clear a 10-foot tall obstruction before moving along that 5-foot path. Repeat this process each round for a total of 5 rounds. Bouncing boom is considered to have the energy descriptor appropriate to the type of damage it is currently dealing. It has no descriptor the instant it is being cast.

Brain Drain					CLASSES:Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=9									SCHOOL:Necromancy																		TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 round				RANGE:Long					TARGETAREA:One living creature																															DURATION:Instantaneous										SAVEINFO:Fort partial						SPELLRES:Yes							DESC:You extract the knowledge and memories from a target creature within range. The spell drains Intelligence from the subject until only 1 point of Intelligence remains and the target is driven insane as per the insanity spell. The caster is free to draw on all memories and Intelligencebased skills of the victim, using the victim's skill ranks, but modified by the caster's Intelligence, feats, and any other miscellaneous modifiers. After 1 hour the ability to access the victim's Intelligence-based skills ends, but you can still draw upon its other memories with a successful Intelligence check (DC 15). If the save succeeds, the Intelligence drain is negated, and the caster cannot access its memories or Intelligence-based skills, the victim instead takes 9d6 points of damage and is staggered for 1 round. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is also immune to that same caster's brain drain spell for 24 hours after the staggered condition ends.

Break Object				CLASSES:Bard,Cleric,Druid,Magus,Sorcerer,Summoner,Wizard=2					SCHOOL:Transmutation																	TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 round				RANGE:10 ft.				TARGETAREA:One object of up to ((CASTERLEVEL)*10) cu. ft. or one construct creature																							DURATION:Instantaneous										SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)				SPELLRES:Yes (object), and see text				DESC:This spell damages objects, reducing the object's hit point total to one hit point below half its maximum hit point total (the object cannot be repaired or gain hit points using this spell). This also causes the object to gain the broken condition; this condition is removed if the object is restored to at least half its original hit points. Magic items can be broken by this spell, but you must have a caster level equal to or higher than the caster level of the object. This spell also deals 1d6 points of damage per level when cast on a construct creature (maximum 5d6) but it cannot reduce the construct's total hit point total to one hit point below half its maximum hit point total. When break object is used on a construct creature, the spell bypasses any immunity to magic as if the spell did not allow spell resistance.

It deals a different type of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) the next time you use it (within one minute). All other parameters of the breath weapon (range, shape, damage, and so on) remain unchanged. This spell is an acid spell when you change your breath weapon to acid, a cold spell when you change it to cold, and so on. This spell has no effect on creatures without a breath weapon. Using a magic item such as a potion of fire breath counts as having a breath weapon.

The bridge is always 5 feet wide and can span a gap of up to 10 feet per caster level. The bridge must connect to two solid surfaces or the spell fails. The bridge itself can hold up to 2,000 pounds plus 100 pounds per caster level.

DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds									SAVEINFO:Will negates						SPELLRES:Yes							DESC:The target is temporarily teleported away in a random direction to a random distance (roll 1d8 north, north east, east, etc.) and a random distance (d100 x caster level feet). The teleported creature or object appears in as safe an area as possible, so it is simply inconvenienced, not endangered (assuming the world has places that could qualify; if cast in the Plane of Fire, for example, anywhere would be dangerous). At the end of the spell's duration, the targeted creature is returned to the exact spot from which it was dispatched. If the spot it was in is occupied, the target appears in the nearest open space.

The mass is sticky and pliable, and can adhere to inanimate objects, walls, ceilings, floors, and so on. You can divide the brightmatter into smaller separate pieces, but doing so reduces the amount of light that each piece sheds. Brightmatter does not generate heat.

Brilliant Strike				CLASSES:Inquisitor,Magus,Sorcerer,Wizard=4							SCHOOL:Transmutation																	TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V		CASTTIME:1 swift action			RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																																		DURATION:1 round																													DESC:One weapon you wield briefly changes into a brilliant energy weapon. A significant portion of one weapon you are wielding transforms into light, although this does not modify the item's weight. It always gives off light as a torch (20-foot radius). A brilliant energy weapon ignores nonliving matter. Armor and shield bonuses to AC (including any enhancement bonuses to that armor) do not count against it because the weapon passes through armor. (Dexterity, deflection, dodge, natural armor, and Pieces Bright Shadowy other such bonuses still apply.) A brilliant energy weapon cannot harm undead, constructs, or objects. The benefits of this spell can only be applied to melee weapons, thrown weapons and ammunition.

Brimstone					CLASSES:Magus,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1								SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation					DESCRIPTOR:Air| Fire					TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:0 ft.					TARGETAREA:One smoking stone in your palm																														DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes or until expended (D)					SAVEINFO:None							SPELLRES:Yes							DESC:A fiery, smoking stone the size of a walnut appears in your palm. The stone is hot enough to ignite flammable materials and deals 1d4 points of fire damage each round that it stays in contact with a creature or object, but won't hurt you or your equipment as long as you keep it in hand. You can use the stone to make a melee touch attack or you can throw it as a splash weapon, making a ranged touch attack with a maximum range of 120 feet. If the stone is wielded by any other creature, treat it as an improvised melee weapon (-4 nonproficiency penalty on attack rolls) or as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Note, though, that any other creature wielding it takes damage each round in which the stone is held. When the stone hits (either as a ranged or melee attack), it breaks and releases a flash of heat and acrid smoke. The flash deals 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 5d4, no save) to the target struck, while all creatures in adjacent squares (including the target and the wielder if the wielder isn't you) must make a Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 round. A strong wind (21+ miles per hour) disperses the smoke and negates its effects.

Within the brimstone storm, add +4 to the DC of all Perception checks, and all land movement is at one-half speed. While the stones fall, and for 1 round per caster level thereafter, acrid smoke fills the area, obscuring all sight (including darkvision) beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20 percent miss chance), while creatures farther away have total concealment (50 percent miss chance), and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target. A strong wind (21+ miles per hour) disperses the smoke in 1 round. A living creature entering the smoke or caught within it must make a Fortitude save or be nauseated for as long as it remains inside and for 1 round thereafter. A creature that makes a successful save but remains within the smoke must make another Fortitude save each round, with the DC increasing by 1 point per round the creature has spent within the smoke.

Unlike lightning bolt, brilliant arc strikes one object or creature initially, and then arcs to other targets. The bolt inflicts 1d4 hit points of electrical damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d4) to the primary target. After it strikes, lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum 20). The secondary bolts each strike one target and deal 1 hit point of electrical damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5 points). Each target can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. The Reflex DC to halve the damage of the secondary bolts is 2 lower than the DC to halve the damage of the primary bolt. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum.

Suitable targets include wanted posters, notices, or letters. As long as the target is within medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft./level) of you, you can concentrate to activate the sensor. When you do so, you can see through the sensor as if looking through a window. The sensor within the paper can be noticed as usual (observant creatures might notice a subtle pattern of eyes appearing in the written material). The spell ends immediately if the paper is damaged. This spell can be made permanent with a permanency spell (min.

This results in the usual penalties to melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, and other uses of the Strength modifier. The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can also be removed with a break enchantment, bull's strength, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell. Bull's curse counters bull's strength.

The spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 25d6) and inflicts the confused condition. Upon a successful Reflex save a subject suffers only half damage. Upon a successful Will save a subject suffers the confusion effect for only 1 round and is thereafter immune to that same caster's burbling blast of the jabberwock spell for 24 hours. The confusion effect is mind-affecting; both are sonic effects. Remove curse does not remove the confusion effect. Greater restoration, miracle, or wish can restore the creature.

The caster telepathically implants the suggestion into the subject. The suggestion planted must not take place immediately. When it occurs it must be based on an event or an amount of time going by. At least three days must pass before the suggestion compels the subject. During the period while the suggestion is buried, neither divination spells nor Sense Motive will reveal that the subject is under the effect of an enchantment. Attempts to remove the suggestion during this period, such as with dispel magic or break enchantment, add a +10 bonus to the DC. The subject does not attempt his saving throw until the triggering event occurs.

Divination spells cannot detect subjects within dead-magic areas, nor can a spellcaster use teleport or another spell to move into or out of the zone. The only exception to the "no magic" rule is permanent planar portals, which still function normally. Zones created by this spell can be repaired, but only by a heightened limited wish (8th level or higher), miracle, or wish spell.

When you cast this spell, a red haze fills the affected area but dissipates quickly, and the eyes of affected creatures momentarily glow with a maniacal red light. Your allies each gain a +2 inherent bonus to Strength and Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. They also suffer a -2 penalty on AC. (This effect is different than a barbarian's rage ability, though, so creatures can still perform actions requiring focus and concentration.) This wrath is focused on enemies at hand. Your opponents have the same feelings of intense anger and a focused desire to do harm to their enemies. However, unlike the controlled wrath of your allies, this fury impedes opponents' prowess in battle. Opponents under the influence of this spell cannot be compelled to leave combat by any means (including a suggestion or dominate person spell) and resist efforts to physically remove them. They take a -2 inherent penalty on Strength and Constitution, and a -2 morale penalty on Will saves. In addition, affected creatures cannot perform a task or use an ability that requires focus or concentration (as per a barbarian's rage ability). All affected creatures still recognize allies and enemies.

All creatures within the spell's area of effect suffer ((CASTERLEVEL),20)d6 points of sonic damage (maximum 20d6) and they are stunned for 1d4+1 rounds. A Reflex save results in half damage and negates the stunned effect.

After the subject attacks once, the spell ends (regardless of success). The subject may have to pass through dangerous areas (moving through a region covered by enemy archers) to get at the creature, or it may even have to break through a barrier. A barrier that requires more than 5 rounds to get through is considered impassable for the purposes of this spell. The spell ends immediately if the subject physically cannot reach the creature-including a situation forcing the subject to pass through an area that would, without a doubt, kill it. For example, a subject that breathes only in water but must cross land to reach its target is unaffected by the spell.

Once the subject takes the object, the spell ends. The creature may have to go through threatened or dangerous areas (passing by guards or moving through an area protected by a glyph of warding) to get at the object, or it may even have to break through a barrier or pick a lock. A barrier that requires more than 10 rounds to get through is considered impassable for the purposes of this spell. The spell ends immediately if the creature physically cannot reach the object-including a situation forcing the creature to pass through an area that would, without a doubt, kill it. For example, a creature with only 30 hp that must swim through acid to reach the object is unaffected by the spell.

Once the subject takes the object and brings it to you, the spell ends. You can force the target to act immediately or allow it to make preparations, though its every action is forced toward working towards the eventual theft. If you give the creature time you can later force it to act immediately. The creature may have to go through threatened or dangerous areas (passing by guards or moving through an area protected by a glyph of warding) to get at the object, or it may even have to break through a barrier or pick a lock. The spell ends immediately if there is no chance that the creature can physically reach the object-including a situation forcing the creature to pass through an area that would, without a doubt, kill it. For example, a creature with only 30 hp that must swim through acid to reach the object is unaffected by the spell.

After the subject kills or destroys the assassination target, the spell ends. You can force the target to act immediately or allow it to make preparations, though its every action is forced toward working towards the eventual assassination. If you give the creature time you can later force it to act immediately. The subject may have to pass through dangerous areas (moving through a region covered by enemy archers) to get at the creature, or it may even have to break through a barrier. The spell ends immediately if the subject physically cannot reach the creature-including a situation forcing the subject to pass through an area that would, without a doubt, kill it. For example, a subject that breathes only in water but must cross land to reach its target is unaffected by the spell.

Once the subject arrives home, the spell ends. Creatures with no home or lair cannot be affected by this spell, although even a regular place to sleep could be considered a "home." The creature may have to traverse threatened or dangerous areas (passing by hostile beasts or moving through a cloudkill) to get home, or it may even have to break through a barrier (like a wall of ice). A barrier that requires more than 5 rounds to get through is considered impassable for the purposes of this spell. The spell ends immediately if the creature physically cannot reach its home-including a situation forcing the creature to pass through an area that would, without a doubt, kill it. For example, a creature with only 25 hp that must navigate a pool of acid to get home is unaffected by the spell, as is a creature with no planar travel ability whose home is on another plane.

The caster has a good degree of control over the area at the time of casting and can create nearly any pattern; the only conditions are that the covered area has to be in a series of five foot by five foot squares and that the whole area must be contiguous. The fire deals 3d6 points of damage +(CASTERLEVEL) point each round to any creature within it. Any creature that is within the area the round that the carpet is created is entitled to a Reflex save for half damage.

A successful Will save results in the spell dealing 10d6 points of damage instantaneously to the creature instead. This spell cannot be dispelled though it can be removed with a freedom, miracle, or wish spell cast on the spot from which the creature was cast out. The damage dealt by this spell cannot be healed magically by any conjuration (healing) effect of 8th level or lower. The damage also does not heal naturally or via fast healing though it can be regenerated; if the regeneration is granted by a spell it will not function against this damage if the spell is 8th level or lower.

Any time a creature (including the caster) tries to cast a spell or use a spell like ability within the area of the emanation, the spell fails as if countered and explodes in the creature's face, dealing 1d6 points of force damage per spell level of the spell, up to a maximum of 9d6 force damage. Thus a failed attempt to cast delayed blast fireball would deal a 7d6 points of force damage to the creature.

For the purposes of this spell, an attack is any action that requires an attack roll, whether or not the attack succeeds. If you willingly allow someone to touch you (such as a cleric casting a curative spell), no attack roll is needed, and thus the action does not trigger this spell's effect. In addition, any creature against which you make a successful melee touch attack also suffers the damage.

Those bound are unable to leave the sight of the group as a whole, though they can create a chain so that one member has line of site with another member. If a member of the group is not in line of sight of the group, that individual is teleported back to the closest member of the group. The caster of chain gang can teleport a single member, or the group as a whole, to her as a full round action once a day for a duration of up to 1 hour. During this time, this spell is suppressed for that hour, but she can dismiss this effect returning them to their original location as an immediate action. A dispel magic or mage's disjunction effect targeting or affecting the individuals or the group has no effect, the whole of the group, the caster, and the spell focus must be present for those spells to be effective.

If this control is based on a spell or spell like ability, you control that spell as if you had cast the spell. If the existing controller is within line of site of the undead or construct creature at this time, you make opposed Charisma checks with the winner gaining ultimate control over the creature. A standard action is required to give mental or verbal orders to a commanded creature. You cannot command a creature or a total number of creatures whose total Hit Dice exceeds twice your caster level. Any creature that has been subjected to a change command spell cannot be affected by any other change command spells for 24 hours. This spell does not affect the mind of the target creature nor the caster, for it targets the spell or effect that is in control.

You apply your control of randomness to choose between alternatives of existence, correcting the choices of fate you disagree with. You may declare any event, occurring within range of the spell, and affected by a die roll to be the recipient of this spell. The result of the die roll is rolled again, and you pick which result of the two actually happens. If the die roll is associated with an event beyond the range of this spell, you cannot alter it. Change fate can affect attack rolls, critical hits, critical failures, initiative checks, saving throws, damage dice (even multiple damage dice, such as 5d6 from a fireball), healing dice (from cure spells, for example), skill checks, ability checks, and caster level checks. It cannot affect your roll for hit points when you gain a level. If it affects an event associated with a roll of multiple dice, you must choose either set of dice rolls; you cannot choose to replace individual die rolls. You can wait to choose whether to affect a die roll until after it is actually rolled, but must state your intention to alter a die roll before any other actions or rolls occur. You cannot alter the past; you can only shape the present as it slips by. If whoever caused the action has spell resistance you must overcome that resistance.

To use this spell, you must stand on the path that you wish to adjust, and must be of a sufficient level to alter the entire length of the path (subject to DM adjudication). If you meet these prerequisites, you can do one or more things, See Text. The spell cannot alter any other objects other than the path itself, and cannot affect magical structures.

The range, shape, substance, and damage are all random, so your attack might be a flaming cone of feathers, a ray of spurting water, a burst of kittens (which vanish moments after the spell's completion), or any other of thousands of possibilities. First, roll to determine the area of effect. After determining the area of effect, choose the target(s). After choosing your target(s), roll to determine damage dealt and then the substance the chaos blast consists of. If the substance includes a descriptor, such as descriptor Fire, the damage is of that type. Otherwise, it is considered bludgeoning damage. Roll once for each attribute (once for area of effect, once for damage, once for substance). All results dependent on level can go no higher than if the spell had been cast by a 10th level caster (if the spell deals 1d4 damage/level, even a 20th level caster will only deal 10d4 damage). All matter created by this spell disappears at the beginning of your next round. If chaotic blast deals damage, the save is Reflex based, and the duration is instantaneous unless otherwise stated. If chaotic blast instead has a spell effect, use the saving throw and duration of that spell. Spells simulated by chaotic blast affect all creatures and/ or objects in the area of effect. Metamagic feats and other abilities that alter the composition or area of a spell have no effect on chaotic blast. This spell is known by many as hail of inappropriate objects.

You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. The bolt deals 2d4 points of damage of a random type with no splash damage. For every three caster levels you possess, the energy, unless neutralized, lasts for another round (to a maximum of 6 additional rounds at 18th level), dealing another 2d4 points of damage in each round.

Objects appear or disappear, terrain shifts, sounds are different, and bizarre smells assault the nose. Usually, the world they see is totally different from what is truly around them. Additionally, the magic is insidious enough to distort the memories of their surroundings, so it becomes difficult to even navigate by memory. The only sense that is not affected is touch, so affected creatures still feel damage and can crudely navigate by reaching out to find obstacles. Also, affected creatures still perceive themselves normally. Once the spell is cast, it continues to affect creatures in the initial area of effect, even if they leave that area. New creatures entering that area are unaffected. Each affected creature is nauseated, automatically fails any Reflex save, and is effectively blind and deaf. In addition to the obvious effects, it suffers a 50% miss chance in combat (all opponents have full concealment), loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, grants a +2 bonus to attacker's attack rolls (they are effectively invisible), moves at half speed, and suffers a  4 penalty on initiative and on most Strength  and Dexterity  based skill checks. Unlike normal blindness or deafness, however, the creature can still hear and see itself normally, and so suffers no risk of miscasting spells with verbal components. A successful saving throw negates all the above effects though the subject is sickened for 1 round. Creatures with true seeing are unaffected. Creatures who gain true seeing after being affected initially suffer no further effects from this spell.

Anyone hearing about you from someone affected by charm contagion must make a saving throw as if the spell were being cast on him in the manner you originally cast it. On a save, a victim of charm contagion can discuss other subjects normally. The spell duration for each affected person starts at the moment of being charmed. Anyone who makes the saving throw is immune to all charm contagion effects that originated from the same initial casting. If you dismiss the spell, you only dismiss it on subjects of whom you are aware.

The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). In addition, all creatures take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage (treat as cold damage for the purpose of resistance) each round they remain in the mist. Creatures are entitled to a Fortitude save each round to halve the damage. A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a gust of wind spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A fireball, flame strike, or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell's area.

The darkness is impenetrable to normal vision, lowlight vision, and darkvision. It also stifles sounds, smells, and vibrations, thus blocking abilities (such as scent, tremorsense, and blindsense or blindsight) that rely on any of the five senses (but not those that rely on telepathic powers or other supernatural means such as lifesense). Any creature that cannot see is blinded. A creature that cannot hear is deafened. Additionally, the thickness of the darkness actually makes it hard to breathe. A character must take a standard action each round to focus on breathing, or she does not get enough oxygen. A character can go without proper oxygen a number of rounds equal to twice her Constitution score. After this period of time, the character must make a DC 10 Constitution check in order to continue functioning without breathing. The save must be repeated each round, with the DC increasing by +1 for each previous success. When a character fails a Constitution check, she begins to suffocate. In the first round, she falls unconscious (0 hit points). This spell does not hamper the air enough to make death a possibility. A character who spends a full round doing nothing but breathing refills her lungs enough so that the rounds without oxygen are discounted. A character who breathes and takes a move action does not regain any breath, but is not penalized for that round. Normal lights (torches, candles, lanterns, and so forth) are incapable of brightening the area, as are light spells of 6th level of lower. Light spells of 7th level or higher dispel the choking darkness. If choking darkness is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the spell's effect is blocked until the covering is removed. As a darkness spell, choking darkness dispels or counters any light spell of equal or lower level																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.68

(This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks and the target chooses the path; the speed of the target isn't taken into consideration-the spell moves the target to the outer edge of the spell's radius.)

The target suffers 1d6 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 10d6) from battering and the hard landing (half damage if the ground is out of range of the effect). At the end of the movement, the creatures are knocked prone. Creatures do not interfere in any way with the target's flight pattern, but solid barriers such as walls and doors might. Should the target encounter a solid barrier, the target deals damage to the barrier equal to the amount of damage dealt to the target by the spell (minus its hardness). Should the damage be equal to or greater than the barrier's total hit points, the target bursts through the barrier and continues on its path.

The land replies as honestly and completely as it can, but it is incapable of answering specific questions, such as "Does Rael Yundri live in these lands?" or "Has a wizard (or the wizard Beldran Sendaer) ever been here?" (Or, "Is Rael Yundri inside this castle or on this farm right now?") The caster can ask about specific spots or features (such as rooms or doors). Queries about a particular set of ruins will be answered about only those specific ruins.

You retain your hit points (minus those granted by your Constitution modifier), base attack bonus, saving throws, class features, and most other special abilities. You also retain all of your ability scores with the exception of +10 size bonus to Strength and loss of your Constitution, for which you have no score for the duration of the spell. You gain a +8 natural armor bonus, darkvision 60 ft., DR 10/adamantine and you gain one slam attack (2d8 plus Strength), your type changes to construct and you gain all construct traits (see Pathfinder BestiaryTM) except that you are not destroyed if reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. Instead, you immediately return to your normal form, retaining the same hit point total. You can choose to take a golem form gaining the magic immunity (based on the golem you have a piece of).

You gain temporary hit points equal to 3 points per caster level of the magic item (though you cannot gain more than twice you normal hp total in temporary hit points).

Unlike normal magic spells, this spell damages attended objects within its area. For each creature caught within the blast, 1d4 of its items are affected by the spell. For each creature within the line, first determine the top four items the creature has likely to have affected (from table below) then roll randomly among those four to see which is affected. Remove that item from the list, add the next most likely item, and repeat the process until all affected items have been determined. Each affected item makes its own saving throw. (If both the creature targeted and the object make their saving throws, damage to the object is negated. If either the creature or item made its saving throw, damage to the object is halved, but if both saves fail, the object takes full damage.) If the object's possessor has the benefit of either evasion or improved evasion, the object gains those benefits as well. If the possessor has acid resistance or immunity, the objects the creature carries also gain the benefit of that ability.

The subject views you and your allies as if under the effects of a charm monster, while viewing all your opponents as his opponents even if they were formally his trusted allies. The subject's alignment becomes that of your deity's alignment. The subject is also forcibly converted to the worship of your deity. Devout followers of another deity (clerics, paladins, etc.) get a +4 bonus to their saving throw against the spell. The subject still remembers his previous life but believes he has had a revelation about the truth of the universe. For example, a paladin affected by this spell could become an anti paladin believing that the whole of his life was a waste as the people he served were not worthy of him and never appreciated his sacrifices. Upon a successful save the target is subject to the confused condition for 1 round. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is also immune to that same caster's convert foe spell for 24 hours after the confusion ends.

This does not cause you any harm, but if a slashing or piercing weapon deals damage to you, a small amount of this potent acidic blood sprays forth, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage +1 point/2 levels (maximum +10) to the weapon in question. If a slashing or piercing natural weapon injures you, the acid affects the creature directly. Either way, the weapon or the creature may reduce the damage by half with a successful Reflex save.

Corrosive Touch				CLASSES:Druid=6|Alchemist,Magus,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4					SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation					DESCRIPTOR:Acid						TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:Corrosive slime																																DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)								SAVEINFO:Reflex half; see text				SPELLRES:Yes							DESC:After casting this spell, corrosive slime oozes from one of your hands, causing no harm to you or your equipment but dealing 2d6 points of acid damage to any object or creature you strike with a successful melee touch attack, plus an additional 2d6 points of acid damage each round for the next 1d4 rounds. If you use your corrosive touch against objects your foe carries or wears, treat the touch as a sunder attempt that does not provoke an attack of opportunity and deals the same damage as above. Washing off or neutralizing the slime can negate continuing damage from this spell, but requires a full round action and a successful Reflex save. Success is automatic if the creature or item is completely immersed in water or doused with something to neutralize the acid (such as powdered chalk or bicarbonate of soda). Wiping or scraping off the slime grants a +4 bonus to the save, but the item used to remove the slime takes 2d6 points of acid damage.

You must threaten the opponent in order to make the counterattack; you cannot take a 5 ft. step or other movement before making the attack. The attack does not interrupt the opponent's action. If you are disabled as a result of the opponent's attack, you may use the counterattack, but doing so reduces you to -1 hit points. If your hit points drop to -1 or lower as a result of your opponent's attack, you may not use the counterattack. If you have a spell effect active that requires a successful melee touch attack (such as poisoned grasp or shocking grasp), you may use the touch spell in conjunction with the counterattack.

For example, if a character is affected by a bane spell that makes her suffer a -1 morale penalty on attacks and saves against fear, then the spell grants a +1 morale bonus to attacks and saves against fear. If a curse causes a character to suffer a -6 penalty to Strength, this spell grants a +3 bonus to Strength. Countervailing affects only targets affected by spells with a non instantaneous duration. This spell does not heal wounds (or compensate for them), although it will grant bonuses to ability scores to compensate for very temporary effective losses, such as the effects of a ray of enfeeblement.

The curse of chaos can be cast in two forms, baneful or annoying. When casting the spell, choose if you want one or both modes of the curse to affect the target. Baneful: The baneful mode of the fluctuating curse can seriously weaken a person. Each day, one ability at random is affected. Roll 1d6 to determine which ability is changed. For that particular day, the ability gains a  4 inherent penalty (to a minimum of 1).  The GM is left to adjudicate exact changes. Changes that are detrimental or positive might grant a circumstance bonus (+/ 1 for minor, +/ 3 for major) to appropriate skill checks. For example, a majorly detrimental change in weight could make the cursed individual so obese to grant a  3 circumstance penalty to all Dexterity based checks, or a minor positive change in body hair might grant a +1 circumstance bonus to social skills like Bluff or Diplomacy because of how well groomed the character looks. This spell is not fatal, does not cause damage, and every day the changed attributes revert to normal, and different ones change. All changes of appearance are merely cosmetic. Fish heads do not let the target breathe water, but nor does the target suffocate in air. A curse of chaos can be removed as a normal bestow curse, and can also be affected by dispel magic.

It also loses the benefit of any extraordinary abilities (such as a rogue's sneak attack) it possess, though it retains its supernatural, spell and spell like abilities. If you wield or are considered to be attending an item that is subject to this spell you are automatically subject to this spell so long as you are attending the item (some items bear an additional curse such that they cannot be removed or dropped). The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with break enchantment, limited wish, remove curse, wish, or miracle.

The ramifications of his new outlook vary depending upon the circumstances. In combat situations, the affected creature does every  thing possible to avoid injury. Flight is his first choice, although he can make ranged attacks if he perceives that he can do so from a position of relative safety. If he is forced to engage to melee combat, he always fights defensively, suffering a  4 penalty to attack rolls but gaining a +2 dodge bonus to AC. Under non stressful situations, the creature incessantly brags about his attributes including his physical appearance, intelligence, valorous deeds, romantic conquests and any other subject that casts him in the most favorable light. His endless boasting and self aggrandizement cause him to suffer a  4 penalty to ability and skill checks with Charisma as the key ability. If the narcissistic creature sees his reflection in a mirror or another suitable surface, he spends the next 1d6 rounds admiring his beauty to the exclusion of all external events except for those that could cause him potential harm, such as combat.

The creature can never again safely travel over land, nor can he be a part of any crew on a vessel. The target of this curse has the material component hung around his neck, marking him as cursed. Placing the component around the neck requires an attack roll on the part of the caster. Success means that the component has been placed around the neck; even if removed immediately, the curse takes effect. From this point on, the target can never travel again. The effects of the curse can be many fold; a colossal monster more than seven CR higher than the highest level character on the vessel may come to attack the conveyance, terrible weather or a disaster (see Advanced Players Guide) plagues the subject and the vessel he travels on. The GM is encouraged to make up any circumstance that will stop or slow the creature's progress to a crawl.

In 1d4 rounds, the creature instead rises as an undead, as detailed below. The type of undead creature is determined by the GM, but it should include an undead template appropriate for the creature. Created undead are not under the control of the spell's caster. Undead created by this spell are created instantaneously, and thus continue to exist even if the spell that created them is dispelled or dismissed.

The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell.

Curse unto Generations			CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=8								SCHOOL:Necromancy																		TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:See text				TARGETAREA:Touched members of family of same gender																												DURATION:Permanent										SAVEINFO:Will negates						SPELLRES:Yes							DESC:You mimic any 7th or lower level curse spell (a spell with a permanent duration that cannot be dispelled but can be removed by specific spells such as remove curse). For a male victim, this curse affects him, his brothers, his sons, and his sons' male offspring for four generations; for a female, it affects her, her sisters, her daughters, and her daughters' female offspring for four generations. This spell has no effect on genderless creatures and eunuchs. This spell cannot be dispelled but it can be negated by a remove curse, limited wish, miracle or a wish. Remove curse and limited wish grant a second saving throw for the original subject; an unsuccessful save results in the spell having no further effects. Miracle or wish must be cast in the presence of the original recipient (or his grave) to break the curse completely. An individual can only be the subject of one curse unto generations spell.

Cutting Flame				CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=1										SCHOOL:Evocation										DESCRIPTOR:Fire						TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 round				RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Six inch long jet of fire																														DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 minute/level						SAVEINFO:None							SPELLRES:Yes (object)						DESC:You cause a white, hot, six inch long beam of fire to spring from your fingertips. The primary function of this beam is for cutting through inanimate objects. The beam does not completely destroy the object; but cutting enough of it causes it to gain the broken condition. For example, you could cut out a hole in a locked door big enough to walk through, and though the door would still be otherwise intact, it would still be broken. The rate at which you can cut through the object depends on its hardness (see the table below). Objects with a hardness greater than 10 cannot be cut using this spell. You can only make cuts up to six inches deep, thus trying to cut through a foot thick stone wall would have little effect. In a pinch, this spell can be used offensively. If used as such you must make a melee touch attack to hit your opponent. A successful attack deals 1d6 points of fire damage +1 additional point per caster level (maximum +10). Attempting to damage an attended object counts as using the spell offensively and damages the object.
