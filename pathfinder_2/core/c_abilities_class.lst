# Alchemist // Incomplete
Advanced Alchemy		KEY:Alchemist Class Feature ~ Advanced Alchemy	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:You gain the Alchemical Crafting feat (see page 162), even if you don't meet that feat's prerequisites, and you gain the four additional common 1st-level alchemical formulas that feat grants. The list of alchemical items begins on page 360. You can use this feat to create common alchemical items as long as you have their formulas in your formula book, though their power is fleeting. You can create these items in two different ways, as described below. An alchemical item you create this way has the infused trait. First, during your daily preparations (described on page 332), you can create items for which you have the formulas. Creating items in this way requires spending 1 Resonance Point to create a batch of alchemical items of that type with the infused trait. You select how many items are in the batch, up to half the normal maximum batch size (half a typical batch is two items, but see the Crafting Trained Activities section on page for more information). You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, and you ignore the number of days typically required to create the items and any requirements of alchemical reagents. You can't overspend Resonance Points to create infused items in this way during your daily preparations. Second, you can create alchemical items with the Quick Alchemy action, described below.
QUICK ALCHEMY		KEY:Alchemist Class Feature ~ QUICK ALCHEMY	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:Cost 1 Resonance Point Requirements You must have alchemist's tools (see page 184), the formula of the alchemical item you're creating, and a free hand. You create a single common alchemical item that is of your level or lower without having to spend the normal monetary cost in alchemical reagents or needing to attempt a Crafting check. This item has the infused trait, but it remains potent only until the start of your next turn. After this period, the item becomes inert and grants no effects. If you overspend Resonance Points to use this ability and fail the flat check (see page 292), you can't use the Quick Alchemy action again until the next time you undertake your daily preparations.
Formula Book		KEY:Alchemist Class Feature ~ Advanced Alchemy	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:You start with a standard formula book worth 10 sp or less (as detailed on page 186) for free. The formula book contains formulas for your choice of 4 common 1st-level alchemical items. The list of alchemical items begins on page 360. Each time you gain a new level, you can add formulas for two alchemical items to your formula book. These can be of any level of item you can create. You learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible to find or buy other formulas, or to invent them with the Inventor feat (see page 167).
Studied Resonance		KEY:Alchemist Class Feature ~ Advanced Alchemy	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:Knowledge, rather than personality, fuels your interactions with alchemical and magical substances and devices. Your maximum number of Resonance Points is equal to your character level plus your Intelligence modifier (instead of your Charisma modifier).
Alchemist Feats		KEY:Alchemist Class Feature ~ Advanced Alchemy	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain an alchemist class feat. Alchemist class feats are described beginning on page 48.
Skill Feats 2nd		KEY:Alchemist Class Feature ~ Skill Feats		CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.
Empower Bombs 3rd		KEY:Alchemist Class Feature ~ Empower Bombs	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:When you craft an alchemical item with the bomb and infused traits-hereafter referred to in this entry as a bomb-you can empower it. You can empower only a 1st-level bomb, increasing its level and causing it to deal more damage. This also increases any persistent damage dealt by the bomb, but not its splash damage. • At 3rd level, you can create 3rd-level bombs that deal double the bomb's base damage as presented in its entry. For instance, if you created a flask of 3rd-level empowered alchemist's fire (see page 360), it would deal 2d6 fire damage, 2 persistent fire damage, and 1 splash damage on a hit. • At 7th level, you can create 7th-level bombs that deal three times the base damage. • At 11th level, you can create 11th-level bombs dealing four times the base damage. • At 15th level, you can create 15th-level bombs that deal five times the base damage, and attack rolls with your empowered bombs gain a +1 item bonus. • At 19th level, you can create 19th-level bombs that deal six times the base damage, and attack rolls with your empowered bombs gain a +2 item bonus.
General Feats 3rd		KEY:Alchemist Class Feature ~ General Feats	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.
Skill Increases 3rd	KEY:Alchemist Class Feature ~ Skill Increases	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.

Code of Conduct		KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ Code of Conduct	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:Paladins are divine champions of a deity. You must be lawful good and worship a deity that allows lawful good clerics. See the list of deities on page 72. Actions fundamentally opposed to your deity's alignment or ideals are anathema to your faith. A few examples of acts that would be considered anathema appear in each deity's entry. You and your GM will determine whether other acts count as anathema. In addition, you must follow the paladin's code below. Deities often add additional strictures for their own paladins (for instance, Shelyn's paladins never attack first except to protect an innocent, and they choose and perfect an art form). If you stray from lawful good, perform acts anathema to your deity, or violate your code of conduct, you lose your Spell Point pool and righteous ally until you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an atone ritual (see page 275), but keep any other paladin abilities that don't require those class features.
The Paladin's Code	KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ The Paladin's Code	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:The following is the fundamental code all paladins follow. The tenets are listed in order of importance, starting with the most important. If a situation places two tenets in conflict, you aren't in a no-win situation; instead, follow the most important tenet. For instance, if an evil king asked you if innocent lawbreakers were hiding in your church so he could execute them, you could lie to him, since the tenet forbidding you to lie is less important than the tenet prohibiting the harm of an innocent. An attempt to subvert the paladin code by engineering a situation allowing you to use a higher tenet to ignore a lower tenet (telling someone that you won't respect lawful authorities so that the tenet of not lying supersedes the tenet of respecting lawful authorities, for example) is a violation of the paladin code. • You must never willingly commit an evil act, such as murder, torture, or the casting an evil spell. • You must not use actions that you know will harm an innocent, or through inaction cause an innocent immediate harm when you knew your action could reasonably prevent it. This tenet doesn't force you to take action against possible harm to innocents or to sacrifice your life and potential to attempt to protect an innocent. • You must act with honor, never cheating, lying, or taking advantage of others. • You must respect the lawful authority of the legitimate ruler or leadership in whichever land you may be, following their laws unless they violate a higher tenet.
Deific Weapon		KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ Deific Weapon		CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:If your deity's favored weapon (see page 72) is uncommon, you gain access to it. If the weapon is simple, increase the damage die by one step when you wield it (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12).
Retributive Strike	KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ Retributive Strike	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:As a paladin, you are a stalwart protector of those under your charge. You gain the Retributive Strike reaction. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature at a -2 penalty before the opponent rolls the damage for the triggering hit. If your attack hits, the target is enfeebled 1 for the remainder of its turn, or enfeebled 2 for the remainder of its turn if your Strike was a critical hit. The enfeebled condition ends immediately if the creature makes a Strike against you. If Retributive Strike incapacitates or kills the triggering creature, the triggering hit deals no damage.
Champion Powers		KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ Champion Powers	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:Divine power flows through you, and you have learned to channel it to heal others. This grants you special spells called champion powers. You gain a pool of Spell Points you can spend to cast champion powers. Your maximum number of Spell Points is equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 0). You regain all your Spell Points when you prepare each day. Your key spellcasting ability score is Charisma, and you're trained in spell rolls and spell DCs for your champion powers. Your champion powers are divine spells. Champion powers are available only to paladins, and they can't be learned by other characters. They appear in the Spells chapter (page 192). Some paladin feats grant you additional champion powers, and such feats typically increase your pool of Spell Points. The spell level of each of your champion powers is equal to half your character level, rounded down, and produces heightened effects (see page 192) for those champion powers that have heightened entries. You gain the ability to cast the lay on hands champion power by spending 1 Spell Point.
Paladin Feats		KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ Paladin Feats		CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a paladin class feat. Paladin class feats are described beginning on page 108.
Skill Feats			KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ Skill Feats		CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.
Righteous Ally		KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ Righteous Ally	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:Your devotion to the cause of good attracts the attention of a holy spirit to aid you on your journey. This spirit can take many forms, each granting you abilities and advantages. Once you have chosen the ally's form, it cannot be changed. The following are righteous allies: • Blade Ally: A spirit of valor inhabits your weapon, granting it additional power. Select one weapon each morning when you make your daily preparations. In your hands, the weapon gains your choice of the disrupting, ghost touch, returning, or shifting property (see page 370), without it counting against the weapon's maximum number of properties. In addition, you gain access to the weapon's critical specialization effect. • Shield Ally: A spirit of dedication inhabits your shield, granting it additional benefits. In your hands, the shield increases its Hardness by 2 and gains the ability to take 2 additional Dents before becoming broken. This stacks with any extra Dents the shield can normally take. • Steed Ally: You gain the service of a trained mount, which is treated as a young animal companion (see page 284). Normally you can select only an animal companion with the mount special ability, such as a horse. At the GM's discretion, you can select a different type of animal companion appropriate to your ancestry and culture, but it doesn't gain the mount special ability.
General Feats		KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ General Feats		CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.
Skill Increases		KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ Skill Increases	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained. If you are at least 7th level, you can use this increase to become a master in a signature skill in which you're already an expert. If you are at least 15th level, you can use this increase to become legendary in a signature skill in which you're already a master.																																																																																																																																																																																																																														BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Skill Proficiency|(TL-1)/2

Armored Fortitude		KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ Armored Fortitude	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:Your proficiency rank for heavy armor and shields increases to expert, and your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. While wearing heavy armor, when you succeed at a Fortitude save, treat your result as a critical success instead.
Holy Smite			KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ Holy Smite		CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:Your Retributive Strike surrounds evil targets in a righteous aura that punishes their transgressions. The target of a successful Retributive Strike takes persistent good damage equal to your Charisma modifier.
Aura of Justice		KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ Aura of Justice	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:When you use the Retributive Strike reaction, you can increase the penalty on your attack to -5. If you do so, whether or not your attack is a success, all allies within 10 feet of you who can reach the target can also spend a reaction to make a normal Retributive Strike against the target. These additional attacks do not cause the target to become enfeebled.
