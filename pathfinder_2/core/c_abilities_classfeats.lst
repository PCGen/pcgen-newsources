# Alchemist
ALCHEMICAL FAMILIAR	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1	PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=1	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat	SOURCEPAGE:p.na	DESC:You have created life via alchemy, though only a simple creature formed from alchemical materials and a bit of your own blood. This alchemical familiar assists you in your laboratory and adventuring, like any other familiar (see Familiars on page 287 for more information).
ALCHEMICAL SAVANT	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1	PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=1	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat	SOURCEPAGE:p.na	DESC:You can identify alchemical items quickly. When trained in the Arcana skill and attempting to use its Identify Magic action (see page 145) on an alchemical item you hold, you can do so as a single action with the concentrate and manipulate traits instead of taking an hour. If you have the formula for the item you are attempting to identify, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check and treat any critical failures as failures instead.
FAR LOBBER	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1	PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=1	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat	SOURCEPAGE:p.na	DESC:You've learned techniques to improve your distance throwing. When you throw an alchemical bomb, it has a range increment of 30 feet instead of the usual 20 feet.
QUICK BOMBER	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1	PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=1	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat	SOURCEPAGE:p.na	DESC:You place your bombs in easy-to-reach pouches and learn how to draw them almost without thinking. When you use the Interact action (see page 307) to draw an alchemical item with the bomb trait, you can draw two bombs instead. When using Quick Alchemy to create a bomb, you can also draw one other bomb as part of the Quick Alchemy action.
SMOKE BOMB	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1	PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=1	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat	SOURCEPAGE:p.na	DESC:FREQUENCY - once per round	DESC:TRIGGER - You craft an alchemical bomb using the Quick Alchemy action.	DESC:You cause the bomb to create a cloud of thick smoke in addition to its normal effects. When thrown, it creates a cloud of smoke in a 10-foot-radius burst. You choose which corner of target's space (or the space in which the bomb lands) the cloud is centered on. All creatures within that area are concealed (see page 302). The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dissipated with a strong wind.
CALCULATED SPLASH	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=4	PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=4	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat	SOURCEPAGE:p.na	DESC:You can calculate the angle that maximizes the damage of a bomb's splash. When you throw an alchemical item of 3rd level or higher with the bomb and splash traits, you can choose for the bomb's splash damage to deal extra damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 0) instead of the normal amount.
EFFICIENT ALCHEMY	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=4	PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=4	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat	SOURCEPAGE:p.na	DESC:Because of the great amount of time you've spent studying and experimenting, you know how to scale up your formulas to larger batches without giving them any additional attention. When spending downtime to Craft alchemical items, you can produce twice the number of alchemical items in a single batch without needing to spend additional preparatory time. For instance, if you are crafting elixirs of life, you can craft up to four elixirs in a single batch using downtime, rather than two. This does not reduce the amount of required alchemical reagents or other ingredients needed to craft each item, nor does it increase your rate of progress for days past the base downtime spent. This also does not change the number of items you can create in a batch with advanced alchemy.
ENDURING ALCHEMY	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=4	PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=4	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat	SOURCEPAGE:p.na	DESC:When using Quick Alchemy to create an alchemical tool or elixir, you can enable that tool or elixir to remain potent until the end of your next turn, instead of losing its potency at the start of your next turn.
POISON RESISTANCE	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=4	PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=4	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat	SOURCEPAGE:p.na	DESC:You gain poison resistance equal to half your level, and a +1 conditional bonus to saving throws against poisons.
DEBILITATING BOMB	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=6	PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=6	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat	SOURCEPAGE:p.na	DESC:FREQUENCY - once per round	DESC:TRIGGER - You craft an alchemical item that has the elixir trait using the Quick Alchemy action.	DESC:You mix a substance into the bomb that can cause one of the following conditions: dazzled, deafened, flat-footed, or hampered 5. If the attack with that bomb hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or gain that condition until the start of your next turn. Use your class DC for this saving throw (even if someone else throws the bomb).
DELAYED BOMB	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=6	PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=6	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat	SOURCEPAGE:p.na	DESC:When using Quick Alchemy to craft an alchemical item with the bomb trait, you can build it to explode automatically after a certain amount of time. This delay can be any number of rounds up to your level, chosen when you craft the bomb. When this delayed bomb explodes, it deals damage to a creature within its square as if that creature had been hit by an attack with the bomb (if there are multiple creatures in the square, choose the target randomly). It also deals its splash damage (if any) as if you had thrown the bomb at the target. Unlike other items crafted with the Quick Alchemy action, the delayed bomb remains potent until it explodes or you defuse it. You can use the Interact action with a delayed bomb you made in order to defuse it. Other creatures can try to Disable a Device to defuse the bomb, using your class DC for the Thievery check.
FAST ONSET	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=6	PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=6	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat	SOURCEPAGE:p.na	DESC:When you drink one of your alchemical item that has the elixir and infused traits and an onset time of 1 minute, treat the item's onset as the end of your next turn instead. When you drink one of your infused elixirs with an onset time that's normally the end of your next turn, the elixir instead has no onset time and takes effect immediately.
POISON ANTIDOTE	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=6	PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=6	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat	SOURCEPAGE:p.na	PRETEXT:Prerequisites - Poison Resistance	DESC:You can use Quick Alchemy to create a specific antidote to any single specific poison or venom you have identified. When imbibed or injected as an Operate Activation action, this specific antidote attempts to counteract that poison or venom using a counteract level equal to half your level rounded up. If you use the specific antidote on yourself and you have the formula for the poison or venom affecting you, increase the counteract level of the specific antidote by 1. For more about counteracting poisons, see page 319.
PRECISE BOMBS	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=6	PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=6	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat	SOURCEPAGE:p.na	DESC:When throwing an alchemical bomb with the splash trait, the splash damage does not affect your allies.

DESC:You've discovered how to mix two elixirs into a single concoction for quicker consumption. You can spend 3 Resonance Points instead of 1 Resonance Point to add a second elixir to the one you're crafting. When this combination elixir is consumed, both the constituent elixirs take effect. For example, you can combine two of the same elixirs to create a combined elixir of life that heals double the amount. If a creature other than you drinks a combined elixir, it must spend 2 Resonance Points to gain the effects instead of only 1 Resonance Point.
FERAL MUTAGEN	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=8	PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=8	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat	SOURCEPAGE:p.na	DESC:Your feral mutagen truly brings out the beast lurking within you. Whenever you're affected by a feral mutagen, you gain the mutagen's item bonus to your Intimidation checks. You also gain two new unarmed Strikes: one with your claws and one with your jaws. Your claws and jaws both have the agile weapon trait. Your claws deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 plus your Strength modifier (plus the extra dice from your mutagen), while your jaws deal piercing damage equal to 1d8 plus your Strength modifier (plus the extra dice from your mutagen).
POWERFUL ALCHEMY	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=8	PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=8	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat	SOURCEPAGE:p.na	DESC:When you use Quick Alchemy to create an infused alchemical item that allows a saving throw, you can change its DC to your class DC.

REVIVIFYING MUTAGEN	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=10	PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=10	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat	SOURCEPAGE:p.na	DESC:While under the effect of a mutagen, you can metabolize that mutagen's power to heal yourself. This takes an action with the concentrate and manipulate trait. Once the action is complete, you regain 1d6 Hit Points for every 2 item levels of the mutagen, but the mutagen's duration immediately ends, even if you are under the effect of Persistent Mutagen.
STALKER MUTAGEN	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=10	PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=10	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat	SOURCEPAGE:p.na	DESC:Stealth becomes a signature skill for you. When you are under the effects of a quicksilver mutagen (see page 367), you can move up to your Speed when you Sneak.

You must have enough space to expand into, or your transformation fails. All your gear is absorbed into your form; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any item abilities. When you transform, you gain the following. • Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction, if any. • One or more melee unarmed Strikes depending on your dragon form (see page 218), which are the only type of attacks you can use. You're trained with them. When attacking with them, your damage bonus is +6. These are Strength-based attacks (for the purposes of the enfeebled condition, for example). • Temporary Hit Points equal to the amount you gain when you are raging. • Resistance 10 against the damage type of your breath weapon. • Blindsense 60 feet, darkvision. • Speed 40 feet and fly Speed 100 feet. • A breath weapon you can activate by spending 2 actions. A creature that succeeds at a DC 24 saving throw takes half damage, no damage on a critical success, and double damage on a critical failure. The saving throw is a Reflex save unless stated otherwise in the special ability description. Once you activate your breath weapon, you can't use it again for 1d4 rounds. Your breath weapon is an arcane evocation effect with the appropriate damage trait. The shape, damage, damage type, and saving throw type depend on your dragon form (see page 218). After you use your breath weapon, you still have to wait the full delay even if your transformation ends and you transform anew. The special statistics of your dragon form can be adjusted only by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses (such as those you gain while raging). Your dragon form prevents you from casting spells or taking most actions with the manipulate trait that require your hands. (The GM determines which actions you can use if there's any doubt.) You can dismiss this effect by spending an action (this action has the rage and concentrate traits). You gain the benefits for your chosen dragon's type listed in the dragon form spell (see page 218). At 18th level, your fly Speed is accelerated 20, your damage bonus increases to +12, your breath weapon DC increases to 30, and you gain a +14 conditional bonus to breath weapon damage.

Attack rolls and skill checks by creatures on the ground take a -2 circumstance penalty. • Any creature on the ground within the area must attempt a Reflex save at the start of its turn to keep its footing and avoid falling into fissures that open up in the ground. The fissures are 40 feet deep, so anyone who falls in takes 20 bludgeoning damage. The fissures are permanent, and their walls require a DC 15 Athletics check to Climb. You automatically succeed at your saving throw to avoid any fissures you create. • Any structure or ceiling in the area has a chance to collapse. The GM makes a flat check for each structure, determining the DC for each (DC 16 for a sturdy structure, DC 14 for an average structure and most natural formations, DC 9 for a shoddy structure, or higher or lower as the GM sees fit). A collapse deals 11d6 bludgeoning damage; any creature caught in a collapse must attempt a Reflex save to escape it.	DESC:Success - Target takes half collapse damage and falls prone.	DESC:Critical Success - Target takes half collapse damage.	DESC:FAILURE - Target takes full collapse damage and falls prone.	DESC:Critical Failure - Takes full collapse damage and falls into a fissure. Your Quaking Stomp might have additional effects in certain types of terrain. For instance, a cliff might collapse, causing creatures atop it to fall, or a lake might drain as the fissures open up below its surface and leave a morass of quicksand. The GM determines these additional effects.

Each spell in the combination must be 1 or more spell levels below the slot's level and both must target only one creature or object or have the option to target only one creature or object. Each spell in the combination must also have the same means of determining whether it has an effect-both spells must either require a ranged attack roll, the same type of saving throw, or automatically affect the target. When you cast a combined spell, it affects only one target, even if the component spells normally affect more than one target. If any spell in the combination has further restrictions (such as targeting only humanoids or only living creatures), you must abide by all restrictions. Handle the resolution of a combined spell as if were a single spell, but apply the effects of both component spells. For example, if the spell's target successfully saved against a combined spell, it would take the “Succeed” effect of each spell, and if it critically failed it would take the “Critical Failure” effect of both spells.
