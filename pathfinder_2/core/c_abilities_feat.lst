Choose a skill you're trained in when you first select this feat. You can forgo rolling a skill check for your chosen skill to instead receive a result of 10 (do not apply any of your bonuses, penalties, or modifiers).

BARGAIN HUNTER			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=2			PRETEXT:Prerequisites expert in Diplomacy											DESC:[Not implemented yet]You can spend the day Gathering Information specifically about deals on items rather than other information. Name an item or a general category of items (such as “magic weapons”) you're looking for and then roll your Diplomacy check. Any bonuses you have when Gathering Information apply. The GM sets the DC based on the population of the settlement, the difficulty of finding the easiest-to-find item, how many merchants are in the area, and similar factors. If you choose not to buy the item using a deal right away, the GM determines whether the deal is still good later on. This type of Gather Information action has special outcomes on a success or critical success. You can also use the Practice a Trade activity with Diplomacy instead of the Lore skill, spending your days hunting bargains and reselling at a profit. Success You find a deal on the item you were looking for. You can purchase it at a discount equal to the value of a successful Practice a Trade check for a task of your level (see page 151), to a minimum value of half the item's Price after the discount. Critical Success You find an incredible deal on the item you were looking for. You can purchase it at a discount equal to the value of a successful Practice a Trade check for a task of 1 level higher than your level (see page 151), to a minimum value of half Price after the discount.
BATTLE CRY				CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=7			PRETEXT:Prerequisites master in Intimidation										DESC:[Not implemented yet]When you roll initiative, as long as you can perceive at least one foe, you can yell a mighty battle cry and Demoralize a foe as a free action. If you have legendary Intimidation, you can also Demoralize as a reaction when you succeed or critically succeed at an attack.
BATTLE MEDIC			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Medicine											DESC:[Not implemented yet]You can patch up yourself or an adjacent ally, even if you're in the middle of combat. In order to do so, you must attempt a DC 20 Medicine check. Regardless of your result, the target is bolstered to your use of Battle Medic. If you're a master of Medicine, you can instead attempt a DC 25 check to increase the Hit Points regained by 2d10, and if you're legendary, you can instead attempt a DC 30 check to increase the Hit Points regained by 4d10. Success The target regains Hit Points equal to 1d10 plus your Wisdom modifier. Critical Success As success, but target regains 1d10 additional HP. Critical Failure The target takes 1d10 damage.
BONDED ANIMAL			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=2			PRETEXT:Prerequisites expert in Nature											DESC:[Not implemented yet]You can spend 7 days of downtime with a normal animal (not a companion, familiar, or other special animal) attempting to bond with it. At the end of the 7 days, attempt a DC 20 Nature check: if you succeed, you form a bond with the animal. Bonding with a new animal ends any previous bond you had. You can't have both a bonded animal and an animal companion (or have a bonded animal that is also an animal companion). During combat, you can give an orders to your bonded animal more easily. You can use the Command an Animal action as a free action triggered after your first Handle an Animal action of the round.
BREATH CONTROL			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1																				DESC:[Not implemented yet]You have incredible control of your breathing, granting you advantages when air is short and allowing you to instinctually hold your breath when necessary. Even if you don't Breathe Deep, you can take actions equal to three times your Constitution score before suffocating. If you do Breathe Deep, you can take actions equal to ten times your Constitution score. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws against inhaled poisons and other threats you breathe in, and you treat successes on such saving throws as critical successes.
CAT FALL				CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Acrobatics										DESC:[Not implemented yet]Your catlike aerial acrobatics allow you to cushion your fall. Treat all falls as if you fell 10 fewer feet. If you're an expert in Acrobatics, treat falls as 25 feet shorter. If you're a master in Acrobatics, treat them as 50 feet shorter. If you're legendary in Acrobatics, you always land on your feet and don't take damage, regardless of the distance of the fall.
CHARMING LIAR			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Deception										DESC:[Not implemented yet]When you get a critical success with the Lie action, the target's attitude toward you improves by one step, as though you'd succeeded at using Diplomacy to Make an Impression. This works only once per conversation, and if you get critical successes against multiple targets using the same result, you choose which creature's attitude to improve. You must be lying in a way that appears to impart important information- in other words, your lie must make the target grateful for your supposed help, which trivial or irrelevant lies can't achieve.
CLOSE MATCH				CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Deception										DESC:[Not implemented yet]You're androgynous, look a bit older or younger than you are, or look like you might have an ancestry other than your own. Choose a different gender, an age other than your own, or an ancestry the same size as yours. You can disguise yourself as that sort of person without taking a penalty to your Deception check.

CONFABULATOR			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=2			PRETEXT:Prerequisites expert in Deception											DESC:[Not implemented yet]Even after you are caught in falsehoods, you pile lie upon lie. Reduce the bonus a target gets for your previous attempts to Create a Diversion or Lie to it from +4 to +2. If you're a master in Deception, reduce the bonus to +1. If you're legendary in Deception, your web of lies is so effective that your targets don't get these bonuses at all.
CONNECTIONS				CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=2			PRETEXT:Prerequisites expert in Society, Courtly Graces								DESC:[Not implemented yet]You have social connections you can leverage to trade favors or meet important people. Whenever you're in an area where you have connections (typically in a settlement where you've spent downtime building connections, or possibly in another settlement in the same nation), you can attempt a Society check to either arrange a meeting with an important political figure or attempt to get a favor in exchange for a later favor of your contact's choice. The GM decides the DC of the Society check based on the difficulty of the favor and the prominence of the figure.
COURTLY GRACES			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Society											DESC:[Not implemented yet]You either were raised among the nobility or have learned proper etiquette and bearing as well as noble lineages, allowing you to present yourself as a member of the nobility. You can use the Recall Knowledge action with Society to gain useful facts about these topics, using the DC for Nobility Lore if it is lower, and you can use your Society modifier on all Nobility Lore checks. If you want to impersonate a specific noble or create a false noble backstory for yourself, you still need to additionally use Deception when presenting yourself in your noble persona.
CRUEL DECEIVER			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=7			PRETEXT:Prerequisites master in Deception											DESC:[Not implemented yet]You've mastered the art of distracting your foes to leave them exposed to your attack. When you Create a Diversion, if you use a Strike action, you remain unseen until after the end of the action, instead of becoming seen before the action.
CULTURAL FAMILIARITY		CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Society											DESC:[Not implemented yet]You've spent most of your life surrounded by people of a single ancestry and know how to get along with creatures of that ancestry whenever it's necessary or expedient to do so. Choose one human ethnicity or one of the following ancestries: dwarf, elf, gnome, goblin, or halfling. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks and Performance checks targeting creatures of that ethnicity or ancestry, and to Society checks to Recall Knowledge about that ethnicity or ancestry. The GM might allow you to choose other cultures instead.
DEFENSIVE CLIMBER			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Athletics										DESC:[Not implemented yet]You are trained in climbing techniques that allow you to twist and weave as you climb without sacrificing your grip. You're not flat-footed while climbing.
DIEHARD				CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1																				DESC:[Not implemented yet]It takes more to kill you than most. You die from the dying condition at dying 5, rather than dying 4.
DUBIOUS KNOWLEDGE			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in a skill with the Recall Knowledge action					DESC:[Not implemented yet]You're a treasure trove of information, but not all of it is from reputable sources. When you fail a Recall Knowledge check using any skill that has that action, you learn one bit of true knowledge and one bit of erroneous knowledge, but you don't have any way to differentiate which is which.
EXPEDITIOUS SEARCH		CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=7			PRETEXT:Prerequisites master in Perception										DESC:[Not implemented yet]You have a system that lets you search at great speed, finding details and secrets twice as quickly as others can. When searching, you take half as long as usual to search a given area. This also allows you to move twice as quickly while exploring and ensure you've searched an area before walking into it. If you're legendary in Perception, you instead search areas four times as quickly.
EXPERIENCED PROFESSIONAL	CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Lore											DESC:[Not implemented yet]You carefully safeguard your professional endeavors to prevent disaster. When you Practice a Trade, you treat a critical failure as a failure. You must choose one of your Lore subcategories when you select this feat. The feat applies to only the chosen subcategory. Special You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you do, choose a different Lore subcategory and gain the feat's benefits for the chosen subcategory.
EXPERIENCED SMUGGLER		CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Stealth											DESC:[Not implemented yet]You often smuggle things past the authorities. When the GM rolls your Stealth check to see if a passive observer notices a small item you have concealed, she uses the number rolled or 10, whichever is higher. If you're a master in Stealth, she uses the number rolled or 15, and if you're legendary in Stealth, you automatically succeed at hiding a small concealed item from a passive observer. This provides no benefits when a creature attempts a Perception check while actively searching you for hidden items. Due to your skill at smuggling, you are more likely to find more lucrative smuggling tasks when using Underworld Lore to Practice a Trade.
EXPERIENCED TRACKER		CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=2			PRETEXT:Prerequisites expert in Survival											DESC:[Not implemented yet]Tracking is second nature to you, and when necessary you can follow a trail without pause. You can Track while moving at full Speed by taking a -5 penalty to your Survival check. If you're a master in Survival, you don't take the -5 penalty. If you're legendary in Survival, you no longer need to roll a new Survival check every hour when tracking, though you still need to roll whenever there are significant changes in the trail.
FASCINATING PERFORMANCE		CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Performance										DESC:[Not implemented yet]When you use the Perform action, compare your check result to the Will DC of one observer. If you succeed, the target is fascinated with you for 1 round; if the observer is in a situation that demands immediate attention, such as combat, you must critically succeed to fascinate the target. You must choose which creature you're attempting to fascinate before you roll your check, and regardless of your result, the target is bolstered against your Fascinating Performance. If you're an expert in Performance, you can compare your check result to the Will DCs of up to four observers and fascinate any number of them. If you're a master in Performance you can fascinate up to 10 observers with a single check, and if you're legendary in Performance you can try to fascinate any number of observers at the same time.
FAST RECOVERY			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites Constitution 14											DESC:[Not implemented yet]Your body bounces back from extreme situations much more quickly than most. You recover twice as many Hit Points from resting. Each time you succeed at a Fortitude save against an ongoing toxin, you reduce its stage by 2, or by 1 against a virulent toxin. Each critical success you achieve against an ongoing toxin reduces its stage by 3, or by 2 against a virulent toxin. In addition, you reduce the severity of your drained condition by 2 when you rest for a night instead of by 1. You reduce your enervated condition by 2 when you succeed at your Fortitude save or spend a day of downtime training, and by 3 when you critically succeed at your Fortitude save. For more information on these conditions, see page 321.
FEATHER STEP			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites Dexterity 14												DESC:[Not implemented yet]You step carefully and quickly, even in adverse environments. You can Step into difficult terrain (see page 312).
FLEET					CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1																				DESC:[Not implemented yet]You move quickly both on and off the battlefield. Your Speed increases by 5 feet.
FOIL SENSES				CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=7			PRETEXT:Prerequisites master in Stealth											DESC:[Not implemented yet]You are adept at foiling creatures' special senses and paranoid enough to take precautions against all of them at all times. Whenever you use the Hide or Sneak actions, you are always considered to be taking precautions against special senses (see the Detecting with Other Senses sidebar on page 302).
FORAGER				CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Survival											DESC:[Not implemented yet]While Surviving in the Wilderness during downtime, you can always find enough food and water to provide yourself a subsistence living (provided you aren't in an area that's completely lacking in appropriate resources). If you are trained but not better, finding food and water for another or providing a comfortable living still requires you to attempt Survival checks and hope for a critical success; on any other successful result, you still find only enough for your own subsistence. If you're an expert, even without rolling you can always find enough food and water for your own comfortable living or subsistence living for yourself and one other creature that eats roughly as much as a human, and on a critical success you find enough for a second additional creature. If you're a master, you can always find enough for comfortable living for yourself and one other or subsistence living for yourself and two others without rolling, and you can provide for twice as many others on a critical success. If you're legendary, you can always find enough for comfortable living for yourself and four others or subsistence living for yourself and eight others without rolling, but a critical success provides no additional benefit. Multiple smaller creatures or creatures with significantly smaller appetites than a human are counted as a single creature for this feat, and larger creatures or those with significantly greater appetite each count as multiple creatures. The GM determines how much a particular non-human creature needs to eat.
GLAD-HAND				CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=2			PRETEXT:Prerequisites expert in Diplomacy											DESC:[Not implemented yet]First impressions are your strong suit. When you meet someone, you can immediately attempt a Diplomacy check to Make an Impression with a -5 penalty rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. On a success, you don't gain any further benefit for spending 1 minute in conversation, but if you fail or critically fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result. This functions only when you meet someone in a social situation, not if you encounter them in a hostile situation such as a combat encounter.
GREAT FORTITUDE			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Fortitude saves									DESC:[Not implemented yet]Your physique is incredibly hardy. You gain expert proficiency in Fortitude saves.
GROUP COERCION			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=2			PRETEXT:Prerequisites expert in Intimidation										DESC:[Not implemented yet]When you use the Coerce activity, you can compare your Intimidation check result to the Will DCs of two targets instead of one. It's possible to get a different degree of success for each target. The number of targets you can Coerce in a single action increases to five if you're a master, and 10 if you're legendary.
GROUP IMPRESSION			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Diplomacy										DESC:[Not implemented yet]When you Make an Impression, you can compare your Diplomacy check result to the Will DCs of two targets instead of one. It's possible to get a different degree of success for each target. The number of targets increases to four if you're an expert, 10 if you're a master, and 25 if you're legendary.
HEFTY HAULER			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites Strength 12												DESC:[Not implemented yet]You can carry more than your frame implies. Increase your maximum and encumbered Bulk limits by 2.
HOBNOBBER				CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Diplomacy										DESC:[Not implemented yet]You can attempt to Gather Information twice as many times as usual during a day of downtime (typically six to eight attempts instead of three to four).
IMPECCABLE CRAFT			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=15			PRETEXT:Prerequisites legendary in Crafting, Specialty Crafting							DESC:[Not implemented yet]Whenever you succeed at a Crafting check to make an item of the type you chose with Specialty Crafting, you gain the effect of a critical success instead.
IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE		CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=2			PRETEXT:Prerequisites expert in Performance										DESC:[Not implemented yet]Your performances move hearts and win you fans wherever you go. You can Make an Impression using Performance instead of Diplomacy.
INCREDIBLE INITIATIVE		CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1																				DESC:[Not implemented yet]You react more quickly than others can in any situation. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all initiative rolls, whether they're Perception checks, skill checks, or any other kind of rolls.
INTIMIDATING GLARE		CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Intimidation										DESC:[Not implemented yet]You can Demoralize those around you with a mere glare. When you do, Demoralize loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait, and you don't take a penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that doesn't understand your language or can't hear you.
INTIMIDATING PROWESS		CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=2			PRETEXT:Prerequisites Strength 16, expert in Intimidation								DESC:[Not implemented yet]In situations where you can physically menace the target of your Coerce or Demoralize attempts, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your Intimidation check and you ignore the penalty for not sharing a language. If your Strength score is 20 or higher and you have the master proficiency rank in Intimidation, this bonus increases to +2.
INVENTOR				CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=7			PRETEXT:Prerequisites master in Crafting											DESC:[Not implemented yet]You are a genius at Crafting, easily able to determine how things are made and create new inventions. You can spend downtime to invent a common formula that you don't know. This works just like the Craft skill: you spend a number of days in preparation and half the Price of the formula up front, roll a Crafting check, and on a success either finish the formula by paying the difference or work for longer to decrease the Price. The difference is that you spend the additional time in research, design, and development, rather than in creating an item.
IRON WILL				CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Will saves										DESC:[Not implemented yet]Your mental defenses are an iron fortress. You gain expert proficiency in Will saves.
KIP UP				CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=7			PRETEXT:Prerequisites master in Acrobatics										DESC:[Not implemented yet]Trigger Your turn begins and you are prone. You stand back up. This movement doesn't trigger reactions.

LEGENDARY CODEBREAKER		CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=15			PRETEXT:Prerequisites legendary in Society										DESC:[Not implemented yet]Your skill with languages and codes is so great that you can decipher information with little more than a quick read through a text. You can Decipher Writing while reading at normal speed. If you slow down and spend the full amount of time that's ordinarily required, treat a success as a critical success; if you critically succeed while spending the normal amount of time, you gain a nearly word-for-word understanding of the document.
LEGENDARY CONTORTIONIST		CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=15			PRETEXT:Prerequisites legendary in Acrobatics										DESC:[Not implemented yet]When you successfully Squeeze, you move through the tight space at full Speed.

You can always talk to any creature that has a language, even one you don't share, in very simple terms and conveying only basic concepts, using a new pidgin language of your own creation. You must first understand at least the basic medium of communication the creature uses (speech, sign language, and so on).
LEGENDARY MEDIC			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=15			PRETEXT:Prerequisites legendary in Medicine										DESC:[Not implemented yet]You've invented new medical procedures or discovered ancient techniques that can achieve nearly miraculous results. Once per day for each target, you can spend 1 hour treating the target and attempt a Medicine check to remove a disease or the blinded, deafened, drained, or enervated condition. Use the DC of the disease or of the spell or effect that created the condition. If the effect's source is an artifact, a creature above 20th level, or other similarly powerful source, increase the DC by 5.
LEGENDARY NEGOTIATOR		CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=15			PRETEXT:Prerequisites legendary in Diplomacy										DESC:[Not implemented yet]You use your incredible skill at persuasion to negotiate quickly in adverse situations. You attempt to Make an Impression and then immediately Request that your opponent cease their current activity and engage in negotiations. The GM sets the DC of the Request based on the circumstances; some creatures might simply refuse, and even those who agree might ultimately find your arguments lacking.
LEGENDARY PERFORMER		CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=15			PRETEXT:Prerequisites legendary in Performance, Virtuosic Performer						DESC:[Not implemented yet]Your fame as a performer of the type you chose with Virtuosic Performer has spread throughout the lands. An NPC who succeeds at a DC 10 Society check to Recall Knowledge has heard of you, and whenever you Stage a Performance, you can typically attract higher-level audiences to your performance, as determined by the GM.
LEGENDARY PROFESSIONAL		CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=15			PRETEXT:Prerequisites legendary in Lore											DESC:[Not implemented yet]Your fame in your chosen lore has spread throughout the lands (for instance, if you have Warfare Lore, you might be a legendary general or tactician).

LEGENDARY THIEF			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=15			PRETEXT:Prerequisites legendary in Thievery, Pickpocket								DESC:[Not implemented yet]Your ability to steal items defies belief. You can attempt to Steal an Object that is actively wielded or that would be extremely noticeable or time-consuming to remove (like worn shoes or armor). You must do so slowly and carefully, spending at least 1 minute and significantly longer for items that are normally time-consuming to remove (like armor). Throughout this duration you must have some means of staying hidden, whether under cover of darkness or in a bustling crowd, for example. You take a -5 penalty on your Thievery check. Even if you succeed, if the item is extremely prominent, like a suit of full plate armor, onlookers will quickly notice it's gone after you steal it.
LENGTHY DIVERSION			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=2			PRETEXT:Prerequisites expert in Deception											DESC:[Not implemented yet]When you critically succeed using Deception to Create a Diversion, you continue to remain only sensed after the end of your turn. This effect lasts for an amount of time depending on the diversion and the situation, as determined by the GM (but for a minimum of 1 additional round).

For instance, you can forage for food even if the plane lacks food that could normally sustain you, and you could find your bearings on a plane that doesn't have stars, a sun, or other normal aids to navigation.

While an ally is within 30 feet of you, their check penalty to Stealth checks from armor is reduced by 2.

RECOGNIZE SPELL			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion						DESC:[Not implemented yet]Trigger A creature casts a spell within line of sight of you, or a trap or similar inanimate object triggers and casts a spell. You must be aware the creature is casting a spell or the trap is triggering. The GM rolls a secret Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion check, whichever corresponds to the tradition of the spell being cast. If you're not trained in the skill, you can't get a result better than failure. The DC of the check is 10 plus triple the level of the spell. The DC for an uncommon spell is usually 2 higher, and 5 higher for a rare spell. Success You correctly recognize the spell. Critical Success You correctly recognize the spell and get a +1 circumstance bonus to your saving throw or your AC to defend against it (if applicable). Failure You fail to recognize the spell.

READ LIPS				CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Society											DESC:[Not implemented yet]You can read the lips of others nearby who you can clearly see. When you're at your leisure, you can do this automatically. In encounter mode or when attempting a more difficult feat of lip reading, you are fascinated and flat-footed during each round in which you focus on the lip movements, and you must succeed at a Society check (DC determined by the GM) to successfully read someone's lips in such circumstances. If you are deaf or hard of hearing and have Read Lips, you recognize the lip movements for the spoken form of your languages. You can also speak the spoken form of your languages clearly enough for others to understand you, so long as you can produce sound vocally.

A creature subjected to this action becomes bolstered against all Scare to Death actions. Success The target becomes frightened 2 and is fleeing for 1 round.

SCRIBE SCROLL			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion						DESC:[Not implemented yet]You can write spells onto scrolls, allowing you to cast them later without spending a spell slot. You use the Craft activity as described on page 148, but you can make only scrolls. Instead of attempting a Crafting check, you attempt a check with the appropriate skill for the spell's tradition-Arcana for a spell on the arcane spell list, Nature for a primal spell, Occultism for an occult spell, and Religion for a divine spell. If a spell appears on multiple spell lists, you can choose which of the applicable skills to use. You must have access to a spell in order to scribe it onto a scroll.

SLIPPERY SECRETS			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=7			PRETEXT:Prerequisites master in Deception											DESC:[Not implemented yet]Spells that attempt to read your mind, detect whether you are lying, or reveal your alignment must succeed at a spell roll against your Deception DC or they reveal nothing.

Select one of the specialties listed below; you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Crafting checks to Craft items of that type. If it's unclear whether the specialty applies, the GM decides.

SPELL THIEVERY			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=7			PRETEXT:Prerequisites master in Thievery											DESC:[Not implemented yet]If you use Palm an Object or Steal an Object on a scroll, spellbook, or similar item, you can remove the magical writing without disturbing the parchment or other surface it was inscribed upon. When you do, you must have a blank scroll or page in your possession that you can transfer the magical writing onto, or else the magic is expended and lost. The GM usually applies a penalty to observers' Perception checks and DCs to notice the theft, unless the writing is on open display (in the case of an unfurled scroll, for example). You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check because you don't need to collect the entire object. However, higher-level magic is harder to steal, so the DC is increased by the spell's level.
STEADY BALANCE			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Acrobatics										DESC:[Not implemented yet]You can keep your balance easily, even when balancing in adverse conditions. You treat a success using the Balance action as a critical success.

In any settlement you frequent regularly, you can use the Recall Knowledge action with Society to know the same sorts of information that you could discover with Diplomacy to Gather Information. The DC is usually significantly higher, but you know the information without spending time gathering it. If you fail to recall the information, you can still subsequently attempt to Gather Information normally.
STUDENT OF THE CANON		CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Religion											DESC:[Not implemented yet]You've researched the fundamental tenets of many faiths enough to recognize notions about them that are unlikely to be true. When attempting a Religion check to Read Scripture or to Recall Knowledge about the tenets of faiths, you treat a critical failure as a failure instead.
SUBTLE THEFT			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Thievery											DESC:[Not implemented yet]When you successfully Steal an Object, observers (other than the creature you stole from) take a -2 circumstance penalty to their Perception DCs to detect your theft. Additionally, if you first Create a Diversion using Deception, taking a single Palm an Object or Steal an Object action doesn't end your unseen condition.
SURVEY WILDLIFE			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Survival											DESC:[Not implemented yet]You can spend 10 minutes assessing the area around you to find out what animals are nearby, based on nests, scat, and marks on vegetation. Attempt a Survival check against a DC determined by the GM. Success You identify one or two types of animals that live in the environment, and you find tracks you can follow if you want to seek one out. If you have the master proficiency rank in Survival, you can also identify one type of more intelligent and dangerous beast in the environment. Critical Success You identify three or four types of animals that live in the environment, and you find tracks you can follow if you want to seek one out. If you have the master proficiency rank in Survival, you can also identify one type of more intelligent and dangerous beast in the environment.

Special You can select this feat multiple times. Each time, choose a different type of terrain.
TOUGHNESS				CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1																				DESC:You can withstand more punishment than most before going down. Increase your maximum Hit Points by your level or 4, whichever is higher. When you reach level 5 and every time you gain a level thereafter, adjust your maximum Hit Points gained from Toughness accordingly (for example, at level 7, this feat would increase your maximum Hit Points by 7). You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to recovery saves (see page 295).																																																																																																																																																																																																								BONUS:HP|CURRENTMAX|max(TL,4)
TRAIN ANIMAL			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Nature											DESC:[Not implemented yet]You spend time to teach an animal to act in a particular way, selected from those listed in the Command an Animal action (see page 153). The GM determines the DC of any check required to do so and the amount of time the training takes (usually at least a week). If you're expert, master, or legendary in Nature, you might be able to train more exotic creatures, at the GM's discretion. Success The animal learns the trick. Failure The animal doesn't learn the trick.
TRICK MAGIC ITEM			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion						DESC:[Not implemented yet]You examine a magic item you would normally not be able to use-for example, a fighter normally couldn't use a scroll, staff, or wand-in an effort to fool the item and activate it temporarily. Attempt a check with a skill DC of the item's level (typically the low-difficulty DC, but the GM could adjust this at their discretion), using the skill that matches the item's magic tradition (Arcana for a spell on the arcane spell list, Nature for a primal spell, Occultism for an occult spell, and Religion for a divine spell). You must have identified the magic item (or had it identified for you) in order to activate it this way. If you activate a magic item that requires your spell roll or spell DC and you don't have the ability to cast spells of the relevant type (such as arcane or divine), you have the untrained proficiency rank and can use the highest of your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma modifiers. If you're a master in the appropriate skill for that magical tradition, you're treated as having the trained proficiency rank instead. If the spell's tradition depends on the caster's class or requires her to have the spell on her spell list, you choose which class you're attempting to emulate. Success You can spend actions to activate the item as if you could normally use it as long as you do so before the end of your turn. Failure You can't use the item for the remainder of your turn, but you can try again on subsequent turns.

Your previous jump counts as moving on the ground before your second jump, provided you moved at least 10 feet. You can wall jump only once in a turn, unless you're legendary in Athletics, in which case you can wall jump as many times as you can use consecutive jump actions in that turn.
WARY DISARMAMENT			CATEGORY:Feat		PREPCLEVEL:MIN=2			PRETEXT:Prerequisites expert in Thievery											DESC:[Not implemented yet]If you trigger a device or set off a trap while disarming it, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your AC or saving throw against the device or trap.
