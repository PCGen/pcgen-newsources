# Weapon Traits - The traits a weapon has appear in this entry. Weapons can have the following traits.
Agile							SPROP:The multiple attack penalty you take on the second attack each turn with this weapon is -4 instead of -5, and -8 instead of -10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.
Attached						SPROP:An attached weapon must be combined with another piece of gear in order to be used. The trait lists what type of item the weapon must be attached to. You must be wielding or wearing the item the weapon is attached to in order to attack with it. For example, shield spikes are attached to a shield, allowing you to attack with the spikes instead of a shield bash, but only if you're wielding the shield. An attached weapon is usually bolted onto or built into the item it's attached to, and typically an item can have only one weapon attached to it. An attached weapon can be removed from one item and attached to another with successful use of the Crafting skill. If an item is destroyed, its attached weapon can usually be salvaged.
Backstabber						SPROP:When you hit a flat-footed creature, this weapon deals 1 precision damage. The damage increases to 2 if the weapon is master quality or to 3 if it's legendary.
Backswing						SPROP:You can use this weapon's momentum from a miss to lead into your next attack. After missing with this weapon on your turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack with this weapon before the end of your turn.
Charge						SPROP:If you moved at least 10 feet on the action before your attack, add a circumstance bonus to damage for that attack equal to the number of damage dice for the weapon.
Deadly						SPROP:On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of the listed size. This damage increases to two dice if the weapon is master quality and three dice if the weapon is legendary. For instance, a master-quality rapier deals 2d6 additional piercing damage on a critical hit.
Deadly d6						SPROP:On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of d8. This damage increases to two dice if the weapon is master quality and three dice if the weapon is legendary. For instance, a master-quality rapier deals 2d6 additional piercing damage on a critical hit.

Disarm						SPROP:You can use this weapon to Disarm with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as a bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Disarm using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to treat it as a normal failure. On a critical success, you still need a free hand if you want to take the item.

Forceful						SPROP:This weapon becomes more dangerous when you build up momentum. When you attack with it more than once on your turn, the second attack adds a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the number of weapon damage dice, and each subsequent attack adds a circumstance bonus to damage equal to double the number of weapon damage dice.
Free-Hand						SPROP:This weapon doesn't take up your hand, usually because it is built into your armor. A free-hand weapon can't be Disarmed. You can use the hand covered by your free-hand weapon to wield other items, perform manipulate actions, and so forth. You can't attack with a free-hand weapon if you're wielding anything in that hand or using the hand for something else. When you're not wielding anything and not using the hand, you can use abilities that require you to have a hand free as well as those that require you to be wielding a weapon in that hand. Each of your hands can have only one free-hand weapon on it.

Reach							SPROP:This weapon is long and can be used to attack creatures up to 10 feet away instead of only adjacent creatures. For creatures that already have reach with the limb or limbs that wield the weapon, the weapon increases their reach by 5 feet.
Shove							SPROP:You can use this weapon to Shove with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as a bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to treat the outcome as a normal failure.
Sweep							SPROP:This weapon makes wide sweeping or spinning attacks, making it easier to attack multiple enemies. When you attack with this weapon, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll if you already attempted an attack this turn against a creature other than the target of this attack.
Thrown						SPROP:You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack. A thrown weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment in feet. Ranged weapons with this trait use the range increment specified in the weapon's range entry.
Thrown 10						SPROP:You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack. A thrown weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does.

Trip							SPROP:You can use this weapon to Trip with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as a bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Trip using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to treat the outcome as a normal failure.
Twin							SPROP:These weapons are used as a pair, each complementing the other. When you are wielding two of the same weapon with this trait and attack with one of them, if you already attacked with the other weapon this turn, you add a circumstance bonus to the damage roll equal to the weapon's number of damage dice. For instance, if you attacked with a twin weapon in your right hand with your first action, you would gain this bonus to damage when you attack with a matching twin weapon in your left hand for your second action. On your third action, an attack with either weapon would receive this bonus, since you'd already attacked with both. The weapons must be of the same type to benefit from this trait, but they don't need to be the same quality or have the same runes.
Two-Hand						SPROP:This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to the indicated value. If this trait applies to a magic weapon, the extra weapon damage dice from it being a magic weapon also increase in size while it's being wielded with two hands.
Two-hand d8						SPROP:This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to d8. If this trait applies to a magic weapon, the extra weapon damage dice from it being a magic weapon also increase in size while it's being wielded with two hands.
Two-hand d10						SPROP:This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to d8. If this trait applies to a magic weapon, the extra weapon damage dice from it being a magic weapon also increase in size while it's being wielded with two hands.
Two-hand d12					SPROP:This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to d12. If this trait applies to a magic weapon, the extra weapon damage dice from it being a magic weapon also increase in size while it's being wielded with two hands.


Unarmed						SPROP:An unarmed attack uses your body rather than a manufactured weapon. An unarmed attack isn't a weapon, though it's categorized with weapons for weapon tables and weapon groups, and it might have weapon traits. Because it's a part of your body, an unarmed attack can't be Disarmed. It also doesn't take up a hand, though a fist or other grasping appendage follows the same rules as a free-hand weapon.
Versatile						SPROP:A versatile weapon can be used to deal a different type of damage than the type listed in the damage entry. This trait indicates the alternate damage type. For instance, a piercing weapon that has versatile S can be used to deal piercing or slashing damage. You choose the damage type each time you make an attack.
Versatile B						SPROP:A versatile weapon can be used to deal a different type of damage than the type listed in the damage entry. This trait indicates the alternate damage type.

No bonuses or other additional dice apply to this damage.
Bow							SPROP:Critical Specialization Effect: If the target of the critical hit is adjacent to a surface, it gets stuck to that surface by the missile. The target is immobile and must spend an Interact action to attempt a DC 10 Athletics check to pull the missile free before it can move from its space. The creature doesn't become stuck if it's incorporeal, liquid (like a water elemental or some oozes), or could otherwise escape without effort.
