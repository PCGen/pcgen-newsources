When you cast alarm, select a password.

Either option automatically awakens you, and the bell allows each creature in the area to awake if it succeeds at a DC 15 Perception check. A creature aware of the alarm must succeed at a Stealth check against the spell's DC or trigger the alarm when moving into the area.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (3rd) You can specify criteria for creatures that sound the alarm. For instance, orcs or people with red hair.

ANIMAL MESSENGER	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|2	INFO:Casting|1 minute (Material, Somatic, Verbal)	RANGE:120 feet	DURATION:1 week	DESC:You offer a gift of food, and an ordinary Tiny wild animal within range approaches to eat it. You imprint the image, direction, and distance of an obvious place or landmark well known to you within the animal. Optionally, you can attach a small object or note up to light Bulk to it. The animal does its best to reach the destination; if it does, it waits nearby until the duration expires, allowing other nonhostile creatures to approach it and remove the attached object. If there are no Tiny wild animals in range, the spell is lost.
ANT HAUL	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|1	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting Verbal Casting	RANGE:touch	TARGETAREA:one creature	DURATION:8 hours	DESC:The target can carry 3 more Bulk than normal before becoming encumbered and up to a maximum of 6 more Bulk.
ANTIMAGIC FIELD	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|8	INFO:Casting|Material Casting, Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	TARGETAREA:10-foot aura	DURATION:concentration, up to 1 minute	DESC:Spells can't penetrate the area, magic items cease to function within it, and no one inside can cast spells or use magic abilities. Likewise, spells-such as dispel magic-can't affect the field itself unless they are of a higher level. Magic effects resume the moment they pass outside the field. For example, a ray fired from one side of the field could target a creature on the other side (as long as caster and target are outside). A summoned creature winks out of existence but reappears if the field moves or ends. Invested magic items cease to function, but they remain invested and function when the item exits; the ability boost from a potent item isn't suppressed. Spells of a higher level than the antimagic field overcome its effects, and can even be cast by a creature within the field. The field disrupts only magic, so a +3 longsword still functions as a master-quality longsword. Magically created creatures (such as golems) function normally within an antimagic field.
ARCANE COUNTERMEASURE	TYPE:Power	INFO:PowerLevel|5	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting; Trigger A creature within range that you can see casts a spell.	RANGE:120 feet	TARGETAREA:the spell cast by the triggering creature	DESC:You undermine the target spell, making it easier to defend against. You reduce the spell's level by 1, and targets gain a +1 conditional bonus to any saving throws, skill checks, AC, or DC against it. You can't reduce the spell's level below its minimum (if any). For example, a 5th-level cone of cold would remain 5th-level, but a 5th-level fireball would become 4th-level.
ARTISTIC FLOURISH	TYPE:Power	INFO:PowerLevel|2	INFO:Casting|10 minutes (Material, Somatic, Verbal)	RANGE:touch	TARGETAREA:one item or work of art	DURATION:24 hours	DESC:You infuse the target with artisanal and artistic vision. Its quality increases to match your proficiency rank in Crafting, to a maximum of expert. The target is a beautiful and impressive piece for its new quality, but the effect is obviously temporary, so it can't be sold for more than normal. This doesn't allow you to use the target to Craft a magic item that requires the new quality or perform any other task requiring a permanent item of that quality.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (4th) If you spend 1 additional Spell Point, the maximum quality increases to master.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (8th) If you spend 2 additional Spell Points, the maximum quality increases to legendary.

AUGURY	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|2	INFO:Casting|10 minutes (Material, Somatic, Verbal)	DESC:You ask about the results of a particular course of action. The spell can predict results up to 30 minutes into the future, and reveals the GM's best guess among the following outcomes. • Weal The results will be good. • Woe The results will be bad. • Weal and Woe The results will be a mix of good and bad. • Nothing There won't be particularly good or bad results. The GM rolls a secret DC 6 flat check. On a failure, the result is always “nothing.” This makes it impossible to tell whether a “nothing” result is accurate. If anyone casts augury on the same topic, use the secret roll result from the first casting. It's possible to get a different result if circumstances change.
AVATAR	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|10	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	DURATION:1 minute or until dismissed	DESC:You transform into an avatar of your deity, assuming a Huge battle form. You must have space to expand or the spell is lost. You count as a deity in addition to your normal traits. Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate it. When you transform, you gain the following: • AC 42 (TAC 39), ignore armor's check penalty and reduced Speed. • One or more attacks, which are the only types of attacks you can use. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +31 and the damage bonus is listed. Melee attacks are Strength based (for the purposes of enfeebled, for example) unless they have the finesse trait, and all ranged attacks are Dexterity based. They target the enemy's AC. Even if they deal positive or negative damage, they don't heal creatures. • 30 temporary Hit Points while you have the form. • Darkvision. • Athletics bonus of +31 unless your own bonus is higher. These statistics can be adjusted only by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses. This form prevents spellcasting and most manipulate actions that require hands (the GM decides if there's doubt). You can dismiss the spell with a concentrate action. When in battle form, you gain the attacks, Speeds, and special abilities listed for your deity below. • Abadar Speed 50 feet, immune to hampered and immobilized, burrow Speed 30 feet; crossbow (range 120 feet, reload 1), Damage 6d10+3 piercing. • Asmodeus Speed 70 feet, immune to hampered, air walk; mace (reach 15 feet), Damage 6d10+6 bludgeoning; hellfire (range 120 feet), Damage 6d6+3 fire. • Calistria Speed 30 feet, fly Speed 70 feet; whip (disarm, finesse nonlethal, reach 20 feet), Damage 6d4+6 slashing; savored sting (range 60 feet), Damage 6d6+3 poison. • Cayden Cailean Speed 70 feet, ignore difficult terrain (and greater), air walk; rapier (deadly, reach 15), Damage 6d6+6 piercing; ale splash (range 120 feet), Damage 6d6+3 poison. • Desna Speed 30 feet, fly Speed 70 feet; starknife (agile, deadly, finesse, reach 15, silver, thrown 60), Damage 6d4+6 piercing; moonbeam (range 120 feet, silver), Damage 6d6+3 fire. • Erastil Speed 70 feet, ignore difficult terrain (and greater), air walk; longbow (deadly, range 150), Damage 6d8+3 piercing. • Gorum Speed 70 feet, immune to hampered and immobilized; greatsword (versatile P, reach 15), Damage 6d12+6 slashing. • Gozreh fly Speed 70 feet, swim Speed 70 feet, no land Speed; ignore difficult terrain (and greater); wind (versatile electricity, range 120 feet), Damage 6d6+3 bludgeoning; waves Damage 6d8+6 bludgeoning (bull rush, reach 15, thrown 20). • Iomedae Speed 70 feet, immune to hampered, air walk; shield (15 Hardness, can't be dented or broken); longsword (versatile piercing, reach 15 feet), Damage 6d8+6 slashing. • Irori Speed 80 feet, immune to hampered, air walk; unfettered strike (agile, versatile S or P, finesse, reach 15), Damage 6d8+6 bludgeoning; wind strike (range 60), Damage 6d4+6 bludgeoning. • Lamashtu Speed 30 feet, fly Speed 70 feet; falchion (forceful, reach 15 feet), Damage 6d10+6 slashing; waters of Lamashtu, (range 120 feet), Damage 6d6+3 poison. • Nethys Speed 70 feet, immune hampered, air walk; raw magic (versatile cold, electricity, fire, range 120), Damage 6d6 force. • Norgorber Speed 70 feet, ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain, air walk; short sword (agile, finesse, versatile slashing, reach 15 feet), Damage 6d6+6 piercing; blackfinger toss (range 120 feet), Damage 6d6+3 poison. • Pharasma Speed 70 feet, immune to hampered, air walk; dagger (agile, finesse, reach 15 feet, thrown 40 feet), Damage 6d6+6 slashing; spiral blast (range 120 feet, damages only undead, Damage 6d8+3 positive). • Rovagug Speed 50 feet, immune to hampered and immobilized, burrow Speed 30 feet; jaws (reach 15 feet), Damage 6d12+6 piercing; leg (agile, versatile piercing, reach 15 feet), Damage 6d8+6 bludgeoning. • Sarenrae Speed 30 feet, fly Speed 70 feet; scimitar (forceful, nonlethal, reach 15 feet), Damage 6d6+6 slashing; everflame (nonlethal, range 120 feet), Damage 6d6+3 fire. • Shelyn Speed 70 feet, ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain, air walk; glaive (deadly, nonlethal, reach 20 feet), Damage 6d8+6 slashing; melody of inner beauty, (nonlethal, range 120 feet), Damage 6d6+3 sonic. • Torag Speed 50 feet, immune to hampered and immobilized, burrow Speed 30 feet; shield (15 Hardness, can't be dented or broken); warhammer (bull rush, reach 15 feet), Damage 6d8+6 bludgeoning. • Urgathoa Speed 70 feet, immune to hampered, air walk; scythe (deadly, trip, reach 15 feet), Damage 6d10+6 slashing; pallid plague (range 120 feet), Damage 6d6+3 negative. • Zon-Kuthon Speed 70 feet, ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain, air walk; spiked chain (disarm, trip, reach 15 feet), Damage 6d8+6 slashing; midnight pain (mental, nonlethal, range 120 feet), Damage 6d6+3.

The effect depends on the target's Will save. You can add a Material Casting action to give the creature a -2 circumstance penalty to its save.

If the target's death seems absurd-for instance, a barbarian at full health appears to be slain by 2 damage-the GM can grant the attacker an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the illusion. If the target acts hostile, the spell is dismissed afterward. This ends the entire spell, so the illusory corpse disappears too.

FORCED QUIET	TYPE:Power	INFO:PowerLevel|1	INFO:Casting|Material Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:30 feet	TARGETAREA:one creature	DURATION:see text	DESC:You quiet the target's voice, preventing it from giving away valuable secrets. This doesn't prevent the target from talking or performing Verbal Casting actions, but no creature more than 10 feet away can hear its croaking whispers without a successful Perception check against forced quiet's DC, which might interfere with auditory or lingual effects as well as communication. The duration depends on the target's Fortitude save, and the target is bolstered against your forced quiet.	DESC:&nl;Success The effect's duration is 1 round	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The target is unaffected.	DESC:&nl;Failure -The effect's duration is 1 minute	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure The effect's duration is 10 minutes.
FORESIGHT	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|9	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:touch	TARGETAREA:one creature	DURATION:1 hour	DESC:You gain a sixth sense that warns you of danger that might befall the target of the spell. If you choose a creature other than yourself as the target, you create a psychic link through which you can inform the target of danger. This link is a mental effect. While foresight is in effect, the target gains a +2 conditional bonus to initiative rolls and can't be flat-footed. In addition, you gain the following reaction. Foresight Trigger: The target of foresight defends against a hostile creature or other danger. Effect: The target rolls two dice and uses the higher result if it's being forced to roll (like with a saving throw), or the attacker or danger must roll twice and use the lower result (like with an attack or skill check). This is a fortune effect if the target is rolling twice, or a misfortune effect if the hostile force is. Due to the amount of information this spell requires you to process, you can't have more than one foresight spell in effect at a time. Casting foresight again dismisses the previous foresight.
FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|4	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:touch	TARGETAREA:one creature touched	DURATION:1 minute	DESC:While under this spell's effect, the target ignores all effects that would entangle or hamper her.

Even if the dispel attempt succeeds, it prevents only the portion of the spell that would have entered the globe (so if the spell also had targets outside the globe or part of its area were beyond the globe, those targets or area would still be affected normally). You must form the sphere in an unbroken open space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects or the spell is lost (though creatures can enter the area afterward normally).
GLUTTON'S JAWS	TYPE:Power	INFO:PowerLevel|1	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	DURATION:1 minute	DESC:Your mouth transforms into a shadowy maw bristling with pointed teeth.

The stored spell must take 3 actions or fewer to cast, have a hostile effect, and target one creature or have an area. You can set the glyph with a password, a trigger stimulus, or both. Any creature that opens the target container or enters the target area without speaking the password or matching the trigger stimulus activates the glyph, releasing the harmful spell within. Once a spell is stored in the glyph, the glyph gains all the traits of that spell. If the spell targets one or more creatures, it targets the creature that set off the glyph. If the spell has an area, that area is centered on the creature that set off the glyph. Glyph of warding's duration ends when the glyph is triggered. The glyph counts as a magical trap, using your spell DC for both the Perception check to notice it and the Thievery check to disable it; both checks require the creature attempting them to be trained in order to succeed. You can dismiss glyph of warding with a Verbal Casting action. The maximum number of glyphs of warding you can have active at a time is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

On a failure, the holder or wielder takes a -2 circumstance penalty to any attack roll or to any check attempted that involves using the object; on a critical failure, the holder or wielder drops the item. The object lands in an adjacent square of the GM's choice. If the object is worn, the wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saving throws against attempts to grapple or shove them.
GUIDANCE	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|Cantrip	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:touch	TARGETAREA:one creature	DURATION:until the start of your next turn or until dismissed	DESC:You ask for divine guidance, granting the target a +1 conditional bonus to one attack roll, Perception check, saving throw, or skill check the target attempts before the duration ends.

For example, you could make the target think all elves are humans, be unable to detect the presence of his brother, think his beloved pocket watch is always on his person even when it isn't, or believe there's a tower in the center of town. The target can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the hallucination every time he Seeks or Interacts with the subject of the hallucination. For example, the target could attempt to disbelieve each time he encountered an elf, bumped into his brother accidentally, tried to check his pocket watch, or studied the tower to spot vulnerabilities.

You count as a humanoid in addition to your normal traits while in this form, as well as gaining any trait related to the creature's kind (such as goblin or human). If this transformation reduces your size, it reduces your reach accordingly (using the effects of the shrink spell). This transformation doesn't change your statistics in any way. You can still wear and use your gear, and it changes size to match your new form if necessary. The item's size change ends immediately if the item leaves your person. You don't gain the special abilities of the humanoid form you assume. This spell grants you a +4 conditional bonus to Deception checks to pass as a generic member of the chosen ancestry, but you can't make yourself to look like a specific person. If you want to Impersonate an individual, you still need to create a disguise, though the GM won't factor in the difference in ancestry when choosing the DC of your Deception check.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (3rd) You gain darkvision or low-light vision if the form you assume has that ability.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (5th) You can take on the appearance of a Large humanoid.

HYPERCOGNITION	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|3	INFO:Casting|Verbal Casting	DESC:You rapidly catalog and collate information relevant to your current situation.

HYPNOTIC PATTERN	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|3	INFO:Casting|Material Casting, Somatic Casting	RANGE:120 feet; Area 10-foot burst	DURATION:concentration, up to 1 minute	DESC:You create a pattern of shifting colors that hovers in the air. Creatures are dazzled while inside the pattern. A creature must attempt a Will saving throw if it is inside the pattern when you cast it, when it enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently fascinated by the pattern doesn't need to attempt new saves.	DESC:&nl;Success Unaffected.	DESC:&nl;Failure -The target is fascinated by the pattern.	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure The target is fascinated by the pattern. While it remains fascinated, it can't take reactions.
ILLUSORY CREATURE	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|2	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:500 feet	DURATION:concentration	DESC:You create an illusory image of a Huge or smaller creature. It makes appropriate sounds, generates normal smells, and feels right to the touch. If you and the image are ever farther than 500 feet apart, the spell ends. The image can't speak, but you can use your actions to speak through the creature, with the spell disguising your voice as appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance check to convincingly mimic the creature, as determined by the GM. This is especially likely if you're trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows. In combat, the illusion counts as a creature for flanking. It uses your spell roll for attack rolls and saving throws and your spell DC for its AC. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell is dismissed. The creature has two actions per turn, which it takes when you Concentrate on the Spell. The illusion can't directly affect the physical world, though its attacks can cause damage by making the target believe they're real. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster-for example, if a Large dragon dealt only 5 damage- the GM might allow the target to attempt a Perception check to disbelieve the spell as a free action. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not suppress regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. When a creature disbelieves the illusion, it recovers from half the damage it had taken from it (if any) and doesn't take any further damage from it. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (+1) The damage of the image's Strikes increases by 1d4 and the maximum size of creature you can create increases by one (to a maximum of Gargantuan).
ILLUSORY DISGUISE	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|1	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	DURATION:1 hour or until dismissed	DESC:Your illusion can make you appear as another creature of the same body shape and roughly similar height (within 6 inches) and weight (within 50 pounds). The disguise is typically good enough to hide your identity, but not to impersonate a specific individual. The spell doesn't change your voice, scent, or mannerisms. You can also make clothing and items you wear appear different, such as making your armor look like an ordinary dress. Held items are unaffected, and any worn item you remove returns to its true appearance until you don it again. Casting illusory disguise counts as setting up a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception; it ignores any circumstance penalties you might take for disguising yourself as a dissimilar creature, and it gives you a +4 conditional bonus to your Deception checks to avoid others seeing through your disguise. You can dismiss this disguise with a Verbal Casting action.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (2nd) The spell also disguises your voice and scent, and it gains the auditory trait.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (3rd) You can appear as any creature of the same size, even a specific individual. You must have seen an individual to take on their appearance. The spell also disguises your voice and scent, and it gains the auditory trait.
ILLUSORY OBJECT	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|1	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:500 feet; Area 20-foot burst	DURATION:10 minutes	DESC:You create an illusory visual image of a stationary object. The entire image must fit within the spell's area. The object appears to animate naturally, but it doesn't make sounds or generate smells. For example, water would appear to pour down an illusory waterfall, but it would be silent. Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (2nd) Your image makes appropriate sounds, generates normal smells, and feels right to the touch. The spell gains the auditory trait. The duration increases to 1 hour.

ILLUSORY SCENE	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|5	INFO:Casting|10 minutes (Verbal, Somatic)	RANGE:500 feet; Area 30-foot burst	DURATION:1 hour	DESC:You form an imaginary scene that includes up to 10 discrete creatures or objects of various sizes, all of which must be within the spell's area. These elements all generate appropriate sounds and smells, and they feel right to the touch. Elements of an illusory scene are incapable of speech. Unlike the illusory creature spell, creatures in your scene lack combat abilities and statistics. Your scene doesn't include changes to the environment around it, though you can place your scene within the illusory environment of a hallucinatory terrain spell. When you create the scene, you can choose to have it be static or follow a program. Though a static scene is stationary, it includes basic natural movement. Wind blowing on an illusory piece of paper would rustle it, for example. A program can be up to 1 minute long, and it repeats when finished. For instance, you could create a programmed scene of two orcs fighting each other, and their fight would go the same way for each repetition. If you create a loop, the two fighters end up in the same place at the start of the fight and at the end of it, but you can smooth the program so it's hard to tell when the loop ends or begins. However, anyone observing long term almost always notices the program looping. You're unable to alter the program after you create the illusion. Any creature that touches any part of the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. If they were interacting with a portion of the illusion, they disbelieve only that portion. They disbelieve the entire scene only on a critical success.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (6th) Creatures or objects in your scene can speak. You must speak the specific lines for each actor when creating your program. The spell disguises your voice for each actor as appropriate.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (8th) Per 6th-level, and the duration is unlimited.

Your battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, or using most actions with the manipulate trait that require hands (the GM determines which actions of this sort you can take if there's doubt).You can dismiss this spell with a Concentrate on the Spell action. If you prepare this spell, choose from the following options. When in battle form, you gain the attacks, movement types, and special abilities listed. You can choose a more specific type of animal to turn into (such as a ladybug or scarab for beetle). This has no effect on your battle form's size or statistics. • Ant mandibles, Damage 2d6 bludgeoning; Speed 30 feet, climb 30 feet. • Beetle mandibles, Damage 2d10 bludgeoning; Speed 25 feet. • Centipede darkvision; mandibles, Damage 1d8 piercing plus 1d4 persistent poison; Speed 25 feet, climb 25 feet. • Mantis scent; foreleg, Damage 2d8 bludgeoning; Speed 40 feet. • Scorpion darkvision, tremorsense 60 feet; stinger, Damage 1d8 piercing plus 1d4 persistent poison; pincer (agile), Damage 1d6 bludgeoning; Speed 40 feet. • Spider darkvision; fangs, Damage 1d6 piercing plus 1d4 persistent poison; web (touch attack, range increment 20 feet), Damage entangles the target for 1 round; Speed 25 feet, climb 25 feet.

If you have legendary proficiency in Performance, you instead automatically critically succeed.

If a creature made invisible by this spell leaves the spell's area, it becomes visible and remains so even if it returns to the spell's area. If any creature made invisible by this spell acts in a hostile manner, the spell is dismissed after that hostile action, reaction, free action, or activity is completed. While exploring, it's easy to move together and remain invisible. This is untenable in a battle, however.

MAZE	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|8	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:30 feet	TARGETAREA:one creature	DURATION:concentration, up to 10 minutes or until dismissed	DESC:When you cast maze, you transport the target into an extradimensional maze of eldritch origin. Once each turn, the target can spend 1 action to attempt a Survival check against your spell DC to escape the maze. The possible outcomes of the Survival check are as follows.

DESC:&nl;Critical Success The creature escapes and the spell ends.	DESC:&nl;Failure -The creature makes no progress toward escape.	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure The creature makes no progress toward escape, and if it was on the right path it no longer is. Teleportation magic doesn't help the creature escape unless the magic can transport across planes, such as plane shift. When the spell ends, either because the target escaped or the duration ran out, the target returns in the space it occupied when it was banished, or the nearest space if the original space is now filled. It loses any remaining actions it would have on its current turn, but it can spend reactions normally.
MELD INTO STONE	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|3	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	DURATION:10 minutes or until dismissed	DESC:You merge with an adjacent block of stone with enough volume to fit you and your worn and held possessions. You must touch this stone when you cast the spell. You can cast spells while in the stone as long as they don't require line of effect beyond the stone, and you can hear, but not see, what's going on outside the stone. Significant physical damage to the stone while you are inside expels you and deals 10d6 damage to you. Passwall expels you without dealing damage and dismisses meld into stone. You can dismiss this spell with a Verbal Casting action.
MENDING	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|1	INFO:Casting|1 hour (Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting)	RANGE:touch	TARGETAREA:nonmagical object of light Bulk or less	DESC:You remove the broken condition from the target if it is broken, or repair 1 Dent it has taken if it is dented.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (2nd) You can target a nonmagical object of 1 Bulk or less.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (3rd) You can target a nonmagical object of 2 Bulk or less, or a magical object of 1 Bulk or less.
MESSAGE	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|Cantrip	INFO:Casting|Verbal Casting	RANGE:120 feet	TARGETAREA:one creature	DURATION:see below	DESC:You mouth words, but instead of coming out of your mouth, they're transferred to the ears of the target. Though others cannot hear your words, the target can as if she were standing next to you. She can give a brief response as a reaction, or as a free action on her next turn if she wishes, but she must be able to see you and be within range to do so. If she responds, per the original missive only you can hear her response.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (3rd) The spell's range increases to 500 feet.
METAMAGICIAN'S SHORTCUT	TYPE:Power	INFO:PowerLevel|3	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	DURATION:1 hour	DESC:When you cast this spell, choose a metamagic feat you have. The next time you trigger that feat, you don't need to add a Somatic Casting action to the spell you cast. Metamagician's shortcut ends when this happens. You can't have more than one metamagician's shortcut active at a time, and if you cast it again the previous one ends.
METEOR SWARM	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|9	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:500 feet; Area four 40-foot bursts	DESC:You call down four blazing meteors that explode. Each meteor deals 3d10 bludgeoning damage to any creatures in the 10-foot burst at the center of each area of effect; the meteor then explodes, dealing 14d6 fire damage to any creatures in each 40-foot burst. The meteors' central 10-foot bursts can't overlap, and a creature takes the same amount of fire damage no matter how many overlapping explosions it's caught in. Each creature in the area can attempt a Reflex saving throw, which applies to both types of damage.	DESC:&nl;Success Half damage.	DESC:&nl;Critical Success No damage.	DESC:&nl;Failure -Full damage.	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure Double damage.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (+1) The fire damage increases by 1d6 and the bludgeoning damage by 1d10.
MIND BLANK	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|8	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:30 feet	TARGETAREA:one creature	DURATION:24 hours	DESC:The target is immune to detection, revelation, and scrying unless the effect is of a higher level than the mind blank spell.

MIND PROBE	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|5	INFO:Casting|1 minute (Material, Somatic, Verbal Casting)	RANGE:30 feet	TARGETAREA:one creature	DURATION:1 minute	DESC:You access the target's memories and knowledge unless it fends you off with a Will save.	DESC:&nl;Success The target is unaffected.	DESC:&nl;Failure -Each round of the probe's duration, you ask a different question and attempt to uncover the answer. For each question, the target can attempt a Deception check against your spell DC; if the target succeeds, you don't learn the answer, and on a critical success, the target sends you a false answer that you believe is a truthful answer.	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure Per failure, but the target takes a -4 circumstance penalty to Deception checks against questions you ask as part of the probe.
MIND READING	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|3	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:30 feet	TARGETAREA:one creature	DURATION:1 minute	DESC:You read the target's mind, depending on its Will save. Once you cast mind reading on a target, you can't target that creature again until the duration ends.	DESC:&nl;Success You find out whether the target's Intelligence is higher than, equal to, or lower than yours.	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The target perceives vague surface thoughts from you when you cast the spell.	DESC:&nl;Failure -You perceive vague surface thoughts from the target when you cast the spell, and you find out whether its Intelligence is higher than, equal to, or lower than yours.	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure Per failure, and for the duration of the spell, you can Concentrate on the Spell to detect the target's surface thoughts again. The target doesn't get any additional saves.
MINDLINK	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|1	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:touch	TARGETAREA:one willing creature	DESC:You link your mind to the target's mind and mentally impart to that target an amount of information in an instant that could otherwise be communicated in 10 minutes.
MIRACLE	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|10	INFO:Casting|Material Casting, Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	DESC:You form a direct connection with your divine source and request intercession. Your divine source always refuses a request out of line with its nature and might choose to grant a different request (potentially more powerful or better fitting its nature) than the one you asked for. A miracle can do any of the following things. • Duplicate any divine spell of 9th level or lower. • Duplicate any non-divine spell of 7th level or lower. • Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects. The GM might allow you to try using miracle to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous, or the spell may have only a partial effect.
MIRROR IMAGE	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|2	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	DURATION:1 minute or until dismissed	DESC:Three illusory images swirl about your space, potentially causing those who attack you to hit one of the images instead of you. Any attack that would hit you has a random chance of hitting one of your images instead. If you have all three images up, there is a 1 in 4 chance of hitting you (1 on a 1d4). With two images up, there is a 1 in 3 chance of hitting you (1-2 on a 1d6). With only one image the chances are 1 in 2 (1-3 on a 1d6). If an image is hit, it is destroyed. If the attack roll is a critical success and would hit one of the images, it becomes a success against you and one of the images is also destroyed. Once all the images are destroyed, the spell is dismissed.
MISDIRECTION	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|2	INFO:Casting|1 minute (Somatic, Verbal)	RANGE:30 feet	TARGETAREA:two creatures or objects	DURATION:1 day or until dismissed	DESC:You designate one target as the primary target and the other as the secondary target. All effects that would detect auras on the primary target instead detect the same types of auras from the secondary target. A creature reading the aura can attempt to disbelieve the illusion. You can dismiss the spell with a Verbal	INFO:Casting|action from up to a mile away.
MISLEAD	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|6	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	DURATION:concentration, up to 1 minute	DESC:You turn yourself invisible and create an illusory duplicate of yourself. When you Concentrate on the Spell, you can mentally dictate a course of action for your duplicate to follow that round. Your duplicate acts as though it had your full number of actions, though it can't actually affect anything in the environment. Both the invisibility and the duplicate remain as long as you concentrate. Per a 4th-level invisibility spell, committing a hostile action doesn't end mislead's invisibility. A creature that determines the duplicate is an illusion doesn't necessarily know you're invisible, and one that can see your invisible form doesn't necessarily know your duplicate is an illusion. If you Cast a Spell, attack, or otherwise interact with another creature, you can attempt a Deception check as part of that action against observers' Perception DCs to convince them your duplicate took that action. This doesn't fool anyone who's aware your duplicate is an illusion, nor does it work if the attack obviously couldn't have come from the duplicate. For instance, if you fired a ray you could make it look like it came from the duplicate, if the duplicate is positioned appropriately, but if you attack with a staff and your duplicate is across the room from the target, your attempt at deception would fail.
MODIFY MEMORY	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|4	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:30 feet	TARGETAREA:one creature	DURATION:permanent	DESC:You alter the target's memories, either erasing a memory, enhancing a memory's clarity, altering a memory, or adding a false memory. The target can attempt a Will save to resist the spell.	DESC:&nl;Success The target is unaffected but thinks your spell was something harmless instead of modify memory, unless it identifies the spell (usually by spending the Identify Magic action).	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The target is unaffected and realizes you tried to alter its memory.	DESC:&nl;Failure -During the first 5 minutes of the spell's duration, you can Concentrate on the Spell to modify a memory once each round. When you do, you imagine up to 6 seconds of memory to modify, to a maximum of 5 continuous minutes of memory. Any memories you've altered remain changed as long as the spell is active. If the target moves out of range before the 5 minutes is up, you can't alter any further memories.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (6th) You can cast the spell on a willing target in order to suppress all memory of a particular topic, detailed in 50 words or fewer. The spell patches these omissions with indistinct haze. Instead of having a duration, the effects last indefinitely even in the absence of magic and can be removed only by powerful spells such as alter reality.
MOMENT OF RENEWAL	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|8	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:touch	TARGETAREA:one creature	DESC:The target experiences a day's worth of recovery in an instant. Any detrimental effects that would be gone after 24 hours end, though this doesn't shorten the duration of any active spells affecting the target. The target regains Hit Points and recovers from conditions as if it had taken 24 hours of rest. The creature doesn't regain spells for resting or get other benefits of rest other than healing. The target is then bolstered against all moment of renewal spells.

You must have enough space to expand into or the spell is lost. You count as an animal in addition to your normal traits while in this form. Your gear is absorbed into your form; your constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any item abilities. When you transform, you gain the following: • AC 36 (TAC 33) and ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction. • One or more natural melee attacks, which are the only types of attacks you can use.

The special statistics of your battle form can be adjusted only by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses. Your battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, or using most actions with the manipulate trait that require your hands (the GM determines which manipulate actions you can spend if there's doubt). You can dismiss this spell by using an action (this action has the concentrate trait). When you prepare this spell, choose the creature you wish to turn into from the following options.

Each creature you're adjacent to at any point during your movement takes 4d8+10 slashing damage (Reflex DC 30 for half damage, or no damage on a critical success).
MOON FRENZY	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|5	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:30 feet	TARGETAREA:up to 5 willing creatures	DURATION:1 minute	DESC:A feral aspect overcomes the targets, making them tough and savage. Targets gain 5 temporary Hit Points, are accelerated 10, and gain weakness 5 to silver. They also grow vicious fangs and claws, both of which are unarmed attacks. The fangs deal 3d8 piercing damage; the claws deal 3d6 slashing damage and have the agile and finesse traits. The targets use their highest weapon or unarmed attack proficiency with these attacks. On a critical hit with one of these weapons, the target takes 1d4 persistent bleed damage. The targets can't spend concentrate actions unless those actions have the rage trait. Their Seek actions gain the rage trait during the spell's duration. A creature can attempt to end the spell's effect on themself by spending an action and attempting a Will save against your spell DC. If a target is in the light of a full moon, they also grow by one size if they were Medium or smaller. This increases the reach of a Medium or Tiny creature by 5 feet.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (6th) The temporary Hit Points increase to 10, the silver weakness to 10, and the damage dealt by the attacks to four dice.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (8th) The temporary Hit Points increase to 15, the silver weakness to 15, and the damage dealt by the attacks to five dice.
MOONBEAM	TYPE:Power	INFO:PowerLevel|2	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:120 feet	TARGETAREA:one creature or object	DESC:You call forth a beam of glowing moonlight. Make a ranged touch attack against the target. On a hit, you deal 1d6 fire damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier and dazzle the target for 1 round. Double the damage on a critical hit. Damage from moonbeam counts as silver for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (+1) The ray's damage increases by 1d6.
MOONLIGHT GLOW	TYPE:Power	INFO:PowerLevel|1	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	TARGETAREA:60-foot burst centered on you	DURATION:10 minutes	DESC:You cause the area to shimmer with moonlight. This counts as dim light, but any magical script or arcane symbols in the area glow a slightly brighter blue, granting a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to Seek them. Magical ink visible only in moonlight also appears in an area of moonlight glow.
MYSTIC BEACON	TYPE:Power	INFO:PowerLevel|2	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting	RANGE:30 feet	TARGETAREA:one willing creature	DESC:The next damaging or healing spell the target casts before the start of your next turn deals or heals damage as if the spell were heightened 1 level higher than its actual level; the spell otherwise functions at its actual level.

You must have enough space to expand into or the spell is lost. You count as a plant if you choose green man or as a beast if you choose kaiju in addition to your normal traits while in this form. Your gear is absorbed into your form; your constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any item abilities. When you transform, you gain the following: • AC 43 (TAC 39) and ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction. • One or more natural attacks, which are the only types of attacks you can use. You're trained with them. When attacking with them, your attack modifier is +31 and the damage bonus is listed with your attacks. Melee attacks you gain are Strength-based attacks (for the purposes of the enfeebled condition, for example), and ranged attacks you gain are Dexterity-based attacks. They all target the enemy's AC. • 30 temporary Hit Points that go away when you leave your battle form. • Darkvision. • Athletics +32 (unless your own total modifier is higher). The special statistics of your battle form can be adjusted only by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses. Your battle form prevents you from casting spells or using most actions with the manipulate trait that require your hands (the GM determines which manipulate actions you can spend if there's doubt). You can dismiss this spell with a concentrate action. When in battle form, you gain the attacks, movement types, and special abilities listed below for the form you chose. • Green Man vines (versatile piercing, reach 30 feet), Damage 6d8+12 bludgeoning; thorns (range 100 feet), Damage 6d6+6 piercing; Speed 40 feet, climb 40 feet; Green Caress: Enemies other than plants within 60 feet must succeed at a Fortitude save against your spell DC or become sluggish 1 for 1 round (sluggish 2 on a critical failure). • Kaiju jaws (reach 30 feet), Damage 6d10+10 piercing; claws (agile, reach 30 feet), Damage 6d8+8 slashing; foot (agile, reach 15 feet), Damage 6d6+10 bludgeoning; Speed 50 feet; Resistance 5 to physical damage; Unstoppable: You are immune to being hampered and immobilized and ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain; Trample: As a 3-action activity, you can move up to double your Speed and move through the space of Huge or smaller creatures, trampling each creature whose space you enter.

NATURE'S BOUNTY	TYPE:Power	INFO:PowerLevel|2	INFO:Casting|10 minutes (Material, Somatic, Verbal) Requirement You can cast this spell only in a natural area that supports significant plant life.	DESC:You call forth nature's bounty, providing enough clean water and fresh fruits and vegetables to sustain one human for a day. If you have a pool of Spell Points, you can spend more Spell Points to sustain an additional human for each additional Spell Point you spend. Most Medium creatures eat the same amount as a human each day. Most Small creatures eat 1/4 as much as a human (1/16 as much for most Tiny creatures, and so on), and most Large creatures eat 10 times as much as a human (100 times as much for Huge creatures and so on).

Any animal or plant creature becomes hostile to it, even a companion creature like an animal companion. The target also has to succeed at a DC 5 flat check when casting any primal spell or the spell fails. The GM might determine that you can't subject some creatures to the ire of nature. For example, a primal spellcaster of your level or higher or an avatar of nature might be immune to these effects.

Nondetection dispels or attempts to dispel all detection, revelation, and scrying divinations made against the target or the target's gear throughout the duration.

The effect is permanent.	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure Per failure, but all creatures the target encounters have an initial attitude towards her of two steps worse.
OVERWHELMING PRESENCE	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|9	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	TARGETAREA:40-foot burst	TARGETAREA:any number of creatures	DURATION:until full tribute is paid	DESC:You surround yourself with a supernatural splendor, appearing to be a god or similarly majestic being. You choose the particular majestic aspects of your new appearance. This causes the targets to pay tribute to you by bowing or spending some other action in keeping with your appearance. The number of times they must do this depends on the outcome of their Will saves.	DESC:&nl;Success The target must pay tribute two times.	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The target is unaffected.	DESC:&nl;Failure -The target must pay tribute six times.	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure Per failure, and the target must spend all actions paying tribute if possible. Paying tribute is a manipulate action or move action, as chosen by the creature paying tribute. A creature under this effect must pay tribute to you at least once on each of its turns if possible. While under this spell, a creature is fascinated by you and can't act in a hostile fashion toward you. The target is bolstered against your overwhelming presence.
PALADIN'S SACRIFICE	TYPE:Power	INFO:PowerLevel|6	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting; Trigger The targeted creature is hit or critically hit by a Strike, or the target fails or critically fails a saving throw against an effect that doesn't affect you.

The spell ends after 1 round.	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The target is unaffected.	DESC:&nl;Failure -Per success, but the effect lasts the full minute.	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure Per failure, except the target believes that everyone it sees is a mortal enemy. It uses its reactions and free actions against these enemies regardless of whether they were previously its allies, as determined by the GM. It otherwise acts as rationally as normal and will likely prefer to attack enemies that are actively attacking or hindering it.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (6th) You can target up to five creatures.
PASS WITHOUT TRACE	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|1	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	DURATION:1 hour	DESC:You reduce the tracks you leave behind, adding a +4 conditional bonus to the DC needed to track you, or setting the DC of tracking you equal to the spell's DC, whichever is higher. You can gain only one of these two benefits; casting pass without trace multiple times doesn't improve the DC further.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (2nd) The duration increases to 8 hours.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (4th) The duration increases to 8 hours. The spell has a 20-foot range and a 20-foot aura area, affecting up to 10 creatures of your choice within that area.
PASSWALL	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|5	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:touch; Area 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall, 10-foot-deep section of wooden, plaster, or stone wall	DURATION:1 hour	DESC:You create a visible tunnel through the wall in the chosen area, replacing the area with empty space; if the wall is thicker than 10 feet, the tunnel ends 10 feet in. Even a small layer of metal in the wall prevents this spell from functioning. This spell doesn't reduce the integrity of the structure, so the wall doesn't collapse even if it's load-bearing. When the spell ends, anyone inside the tunnel is shunted to the nearest exit.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (7th) The tunnel can be up to 20 feet deep. The areas of the wall that contain your tunnel's entrance (and exit, if applicable) appear completely normal (unless subjected to true seeing), despite the tunnel's existence.

PEST FORM	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|2	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	DURATION:10 minutes or until dismissed	DESC:You transform into a Tiny nonthreatening animal, such as a cat, rat, insect, or lizard. You count as an animal in addition to your normal traits while in this form. You can choose the specific type of animal you turn into (such as a rat or praying mantis).

PLANE SHIFT	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|7	INFO:Casting|10 minutes (Material, Somatic, Verbal)	RANGE:touch	TARGETAREA:one willing creature, or up to eight willing creatures joining hands	DESC:The target or targets move to another dimensional plane, such as the Plane of Fire, the Shadow Plane, Hell, or the Abyss. Attempting to reach a particular plane requires specific knowledge of the plane and a magic tuning fork created from material from that plane; while the tuning forks for most prominent planes are uncommon, just like the spell plane shift, more obscure planes and demiplanes often have rare tuning forks. The spell is highly imprecise, and you appear 1d20×25 miles from the last place one of the targets (of your choice) was located the last time that target traveled to the plane. If it's the first time traveling to a particular plane for all targets, you appear at a random location on the plane, though you can use other means of transit, such as teleport, to travel while on the new plane. Plane shift doesn't provide a means of return travel, though casting plane shift again allows you to return to your previous plane unless there are extenuating circumstances.

The special statistics of your battle form can be adjusted only by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses. Your battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, or spending most action with the manipulate trait that require your hands (the GM determines which manipulate actions you can spend if there's doubt). You can dismiss this spell by using an action (this action has the concentrate trait). When you prepare this spell, choose the creature you wish to turn into from the following options. When in battle form, you gain the attacks, movement types, and special abilities listed. You can substitute a similar specific plant to turn into (such as a pitcher plant instead of a flytrap). This has no effect on your battle form's size or statistics. • Flytrap jaws (reach 10 feet), Damage 2d8 piercing and you can spend an action immediately after a hit to grab the target; Speed 15 feet; resistance 10 to acid • Shambling Mound vine (reach 15 feet), Damage 2d8 slashing; Speed 20 feet, swim 20 feet; resistance 10 to electricity • Treant branch (reach 15 feet), Damage 2d10 bludgeoning; foot, Damage 2d8 bludgeoning; Speed 30 feet; you can speak in this form, but still can't supply Verbal components.

DESC:&nl;Success You possess the target but can't control it, riding along in its body while the spell lasts.	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The target is unaffected.

The effects are minor and have severe limitations. Each time you Concentrate on the Spell, you can choose one of four options, based on your type of magic. • Cook (arcane, primal) Chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. • Lift (arcane, divine, occult) Slowly lift an unattended object of light Bulk or less 1 foot off the ground. • Make (arcane, divine, occult) Create an object of negligible Bulk, made of congealed magical substance and temporary in nature. The object looks crude and artificial and is extremely fragile-it crumbles if put under too much strain and can't be used as a tool, weapon, or spell component. • Tidy (arcane, primal) Color, clean, or soil an object of light or less Bulk. You can affect an object of 1 Bulk with 10 rounds of concentration or a larger object, such as a suit of armor, with 5 minutes of concentration. Prestidigitation can't deal damage or cause adverse conditions. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, coloring, or soiling it) persists only as long as you Concentrate on the Spell.

When targets transform, each target gains the following abilities: • AC 41 (TAC 38) and ignores armor's check penalty and Speed reduction. • New attacks, which are the only types of attacks they can use. They're trained with them. When attacking with them, they use their attack modifier with the proficiency and item bonus of their most favorable weapon or unarmed Strike, and the damage bonus is listed with the attacks. All attacks are Strength-based attacks (for the purposes of the enfeebled condition, for example). • 20 temporary Hit Points that go away when they leave their battle form. • Low-light vision. • Athletics +28 (unless their own total modifiers are higher). The special statistics of the battle form can be adjusted only by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses. The battle form prevents the targets from casting spells, or spending most manipulate actions that require hands (the GM determines which manipulate actions you can spend if there's doubt). Each target can dismiss the spell's effects on her own by using an action (this action has the concentrate trait). When in battle form, each target gains the attacks, movement types, and special abilities listed below. • Mammoth tusk (reach 15 feet), Damage 6d8+9 piercing; trunk (agile, reach 15 feet), Damage 6d6+9 bludgeoning; foot (agile, reach 15 feet), Damage 6d6+3 bludgeoning; Speed 40 feet; Trample: As a 3-action activity, you can move up to twice your Speed and move through the space of Large or smaller creatures, trampling each creature whose space you enter.

PRIMAL PHENOMENON	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|10	INFO:Casting|Material Casting, Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	DESC:You form a direct connection with the natural world and request intercession. Nature always refuses unnatural requests and might choose to grant a different request (potentially more powerful or better fitting its nature) than the one you asked for. A primal phenomenon spell can do any of the following things. • Duplicate any primal spell of 9th level or lower. • Duplicate any non-primal spell of 7th level or lower. • Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects. At the GM's discretion, you can try to use primal phenomenon to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous or the spell may have only a partial effect.
PRISMATIC SPHERE	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|9	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:10 feet	DURATION:1 hour	DESC:This multicolored sphere functions like a prismatic wall but is shaped in a 10-foot burst centered on a corner within your space.

PRISMATIC SPRAY	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|7	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	TARGETAREA:30-foot cone	DESC:A spray of rainbow light beams cascades from your open hand. Each creature in the area must roll 1d8 on the table below to see which beam affects it, then roll a saving throw of the indicated type. The table notes any additional traits that apply to each type of ray. If a creature is struck by multiple beams, it uses the same d20 result for all its saving throws. For all rays, a successful saving throw negates the effect for that creature. 1d8 Color Save Effect (Traits) 1 Red Reflex 30 fire damage (fire) 2 Orange Reflex 40 acid damage (acid) 3 Yellow Reflex 50 electricity damage (electricity) 4 Green Fortitude 20 poison damage and enfeebled 1 for 1 minute (poison) 5 Blue Fortitude Affected as if by flesh to stone Divination Abjuration Evocation 6 Indigo Will Confused, per the warp mind spell (mental) 7 Violet Will Slowed 1 for 1 minute; sent to another plane, per plane shift, on a critical failure (teleportation) 8 Potent beam - Affected by two beams- roll twice, rerolling any duplicates or 8s
PRISMATIC WALL	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|8	INFO:Casting|Material Casting, Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:120 feet	DURATION:1 hour or until dismissed	DESC:You create an opaque wall of shimmering, multicolored light. The wall is straight and vertical, stretching 60 feet across and 30 feet high. You must form the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects or the spell is lost. You can pass through the wall and ignore its effects. The wall sheds bright light out to 20 feet on each side. Creatures other than you that come into the wall's light must succeed at a Will save or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature that attempts a save is then bolstered against that particular prismatic wall's blinding effect. A prismatic wall has seven different colors, each with the effect of a 5th-level chromatic wall spell of that color. A creature that tries to pass through the wall must attempt a saving throw against each component wall. The effects take place simultaneously, so a creature turned to stone by the blue wall is still treated as a creature for the indigo and violet walls. The wall as a whole is immune to dispelling effects of the wall's level or lower, but each color must be dispelled by its specific spell, as described in chromatic wall. This must be done in order (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, then violet). A given color can't be affected until the previous color is dispelled. Dispelling a color wall removes that color's effect from the wall, and dispelling them all ends prismatic wall.
PRIVATE SANCTUM	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|4	INFO:Casting|10 minutes (Material, Somatic, Verbal)	RANGE:touch; Area 100-foot burst	DURATION:24 hours	DESC:The area looks like a bank of impenetrable black fog.

You must stay within range of the image, and if at any point you can't see the image, the spell ends. Whenever you Cast a Spell other than an aura spell, you can cause the spell effect to originate from either yourself or the image. Because the image is an illusion, it can't truly benefit from spells, though any visual manifestations of the spell appear. The image has AC equal to your TAC and the same saves as you. If it is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (+2) The maximum duration you can Concentrate on the Spell increases to 10 minutes.

Any creature that ends its turn flying within the area descends 20 feet. Any creature pushed into a surface by this spell's winds takes falling damage. The squares at the outside vertical edges of the cylinder prevent creatures from leaving. They're greater difficult terrain, and any creature attempting to push through must succeed at an Athletics check (or Flying Maneuver) against your spell DC to get through.

If the spell is successful, the creature is no longer dead and returns to life with 1 Hit Point, no spells prepared, no points in any pools, and it is still suffering from any longterm debilitations of the old body. The time spent in the Boneyard leaves the character temporarily debilitated, making it enervated 2 for 1 week; this condition can't be removed or reduced by any means until the week has passed.

If you critically succeed at your attack roll, the target treats the result of its Fortitude save as one degree worse.	DESC:&nl;Success The target gains enfeebled 1.	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The target is unaffected.	DESC:&nl;Failure -The target gains enfeebled 2.	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure The target gains enfeebled 3.
RAY OF FROST	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|Cantrip	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:60 feet	TARGETAREA:one creature	DESC:Make a ranged touch attack against the target. If you hit, you deal 1d8 cold damage. Double the damage on a critical hit. Heightening this spell increases its damage.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (3rd) The cold damage increases to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (5th) The cold damage increases to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (7th) The cold damage increases to 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (9th) The cold damage increases to 4d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
READ AURA	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|Cantrip	INFO:Casting|10 minutes (Somatic, Verbal)	RANGE:30 feet	TARGETAREA:one object	DESC:You focus on the target object. When the casting is complete, you know whether or not that item is magical and, if it is, you learn the school of magic (see page 194). If the object is illusory, you detect this only if the effect has a lower level than the level of your read aura spell.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (3rd) You can target up to 10 objects.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (6th) You can target any number of objects.
READ FATE	TYPE:Power	INFO:PowerLevel|1	INFO:Casting|10 minutes (Material, Somatic, Verbal)	RANGE:10 feet	TARGETAREA:one creature other than you	DESC:You attempt to learn more about the target's fate in the short term, usually within the next day for a creature living a fairly sedentary life, or the next hour or less for someone likely to have multiple rapid experiences of note, such as someone actively adventuring. You learn a single enigmatic word connected to the creature's fate that day. Fate is notoriously fickle and inscrutable, and the word isn't necessarily meant to be taken at face value, so the meaning is often clear only in hindsight. The GM rolls a secret DC 6 flat check (see page 292). If the creature's fate is too uncertain, or on a failed flat check, the spell results in the word “inconclusive.” Either way, the creature is bolstered against read fate.
READ OMENS	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|4	INFO:Casting|10 minutes (Material, Somatic, Verbal)	DESC:Choose a particular goal, event, or activity that will occur within 1 week. You learn a cryptic clue or piece of advice that could help with the chosen event, often in the form of a rhyme or omen.
REGENERATE	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|7	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:touch	TARGETAREA:one willing or unconscious living creature	DURATION:1 minute	DESC:The target temporarily gains regeneration 15, which restores 15 Hit Points to it at the start of each of its turns. While it has regeneration, the target can't die from damage and its dying value can't exceed 3. If the target takes acid or fire damage, its regeneration deactivates until after the end of its next turn. Each time the creature regains Hit Points from regeneration, it also regrows one damaged or ruined organ (if any). During the spell's duration, the creature can also reattach severed body parts by spending an Interact action to hold the body part to the stump.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (9th) The regeneration increases to 20.
REMOVE CURSE	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|4	INFO:Casting|10 minutes (Material, Somatic, Verbal)	RANGE:touch	TARGETAREA:one creature	DESC:You attempt to remove one curse afflicting the target. Treat this as counteracting the curse (see page 319). If the curse comes from a cursed item or other external source, a success indicates that the target creature can rid itself of the cursed item, but doesn't remove the curse from the item.
REMOVE DISEASE	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|3	INFO:Casting|10 minutes (Material, Somatic, Verbal)	RANGE:touch	TARGETAREA:one creature	DESC:You attempt to completely remove one disease afflicting the target. Treat this as counteracting the disease (see page 319).
REMOVE FEAR	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|2	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:touch	TARGETAREA:one creature	DESC:You can counteract a single fear effect that the target suffers from. This can also remove nonmagical fear effects if the source's level is equal to or lower than double remove fear's level. This frees only the target, not any other creatures under the fear effect.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (6th) The spell's range increases to 30 feet, and you can target up to 10 creatures.
REMOVE PARALYSIS	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|2	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:touch	TARGETAREA:one creature	DESC:You can counteract a single effect inflicting paralysis on the creature.

DESC:&nl;Heightened (6th) The spell's range increases to 30 feet, and you can target up to 10 creatures.
REPULSION	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|6	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:aura up to 40 feet	DURATION:1 minute	DESC:From you extends an aura that prevents creatures from approaching you. When casting the spell, you can make the field any radius you choose, up to 40 feet. Creatures must attempt a Will save if they're in the aura when you cast the spell or as soon as they enter the aura while it's in effect. Once a creature has attempted the save, it uses the same result for that casting of repulsion. Any restrictions on a creature's movement apply only if it moves voluntarily toward you. For example, if you move closer to a creature, it doesn't then need to move away.	DESC:&nl;Success The creature treats each square in the aura as difficult terrain when is moving closer to you.	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The creature's movement is not restricted.	DESC:&nl;Failure -The creature can't move closer to you while in the aura.
RESILIENT SPHERE	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|4	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:30 feet	TARGETAREA:one Large or smaller creature	DURATION:1 minute	DESC:You create an immobile sphere of force around the target's space to either trap or protect it, blocking anything that would cross through the sphere. The sphere has AC 5, TAC 5, and Hardness 10. It can take 2 extra Dents and is destroyed when broken. Disintegrate destroys the sphere instantly. The spell's duration ends when the sphere is destroyed. If the target is unwilling, the effects of the sphere depend on the target's Reflex save.	DESC:&nl;Success The target disrupts the sphere's integrity, so the sphere functions normally but begins with 3 Dents.	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The target disrupts the sphere, causing it to collapse entirely.	DESC:&nl;Failure -The sphere has its normal effect.
RESIST ENERGY	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|2	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:touch	TARGETAREA:one creature	DURATION:1 minute	DESC:Choose acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. The target and its gear gain resistance 5 against the damage type you chose.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (4th) The resistance increases to 10, and you can target up to two creatures.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (7th) The resistance increases to 15, and you can target up to five creatures.
RESPLENDENT MANSION	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|9	INFO:Casting|1 minute (Material, Somatic, Verbal)	RANGE:500 feet	DURATION:24 hours (see text)	DESC:You conjure a towering mansion up to four stories tall and up to 300 feet on a side. While casting the spell, you hold an image of the mansion and its desired appearance in your mind. The mansion can contain as many or as few rooms as you desire, and it is decorated as you imagine it. You can imagine a purpose for each room of the mansion, and the proper accouterments appear within. Any furniture or other mundane fixtures function normally for anyone inside the mansion, but they cease to exist if taken beyond its walls. No fixture created with this spell can create magical effects, but magical devices brought into the mansion function normally. Your mansion contains the same types of foodstuffs and servants as created by the magnificent mansion spell. Each of the mansion's exterior doorways and windows are protected by alarm spells. You choose whether each alarm is audible or mental as you cast the spell, and each has a different sound (for an audible alarm) or sensation (for a mental one), allowing you to instantly determine which portal has been used. When you prepare spells, you can choose not to recover the spell slot or daily spell you used to cast this spell. If you do, the mansion remains for another 24 hours. The mansion must be created on a plot of land free of other structures. It adapts to the natural terrain, adopting the structural requirements for being built there. The mansion adjusts around small features such as ponds or spires of rock, but can't be created on water or other nonsolid surfaces. If created on snow, sand dunes, or other soft surfaces with a solid surface underneath, the foundation reaches the solid ground. If created on a solid but unstable surface, such as a swamp or an area plagued by tremors, there's a 10% chance each day the mansion begins to sink or collapse. The mansion doesn't harm creatures within the area when it appears, and it can't be created within a crowd or in a densely populated area. Any creature inadvertently caught inside the mansion when the spell is cast ends up unharmed inside the complete mansion and always has a clear path of escape.
RESTORATION	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|2	INFO:Casting|10 minutes (Somatic, Verbal)	RANGE:touch	TARGETAREA:one creature	DESC:When you cast restoration, choose to either reduce a condition or lessen the effect of a toxin. A creature can benefit from only one restoration spell each day, and it can't benefit from restoration more than once to reduce the stage of the same exposure to a given toxin. • Reduce a Condition Reduce the value of the target's enfeebled, sluggish, or stupefied condition by 2. You can instead reduce two of the listed conditions by 1 each. • Lessen a Toxin Reduce the stage of one toxin the target suffers from by one stage. This can't reduce the stage below stage 1 or cure the affliction.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (4th) Add drained to the list of conditions you can reduce. When you lessen a toxin, reduce the stage by two. You also gain a third option that allows you to reduce the target's enervated value by 1. You can't use this to reduce a permanent enervated condition.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (6th) Per the 4th-level restoration, but you can reduce a permanent enervated condition if you add a Material	INFO:Casting|action while casting the spell, during which you provide 100 gp worth of diamond dust as a cost.
RESTORE SENSES	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|2	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:touch	TARGETAREA:one creature	DESC:You can counteract a single effect making the target blinded or deafened. This can counteract both temporary magic and permanent consequences of magic, but it doesn't cure someone who is missing the sense from some natural state or effect, such as from birth or from a nonmagical wound or toxin.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (6th) The spell's range increases to 30 feet, and you can target up to 10 creatures. You can choose the effect to counteract separately for each selected creature.
RETRIBUTIVE PAIN	TYPE:Power	INFO:PowerLevel|2	INFO:Casting|Somatic reaction; Trigger A creature in retributive pain's range deals damage to you.	RANGE:30 feet	TARGETAREA:one creature	DESC:You vengefully reflect a portion of your pain upon your tormentor. The mental damage you deal is equal to half the damage the target dealt to you with the triggering effect, to a maximum of 10 mental damage. This damage decreases or increases depending on the target's Fortitude save.	DESC:&nl;Success Half damage.	DESC:&nl;Critical Success No damage.	DESC:&nl;Failure -Full damage.	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure Double damage (this can exceed 10 mental damage)	DESC:&nl;Heightened (+1) The maximum mental damage increases by 5.
RETROCOGNITION	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|7	INFO:Casting|1 minute (Material, Somatic, Verbal)	DURATION:concentration, up to 10 minutes	DESC:This spell allows you to gain impressions from past events that occurred in your current location. Retrocognition reveals impressions from events that occurred over the course of the last day throughout the first minute of the duration, followed by impressions from the next day back the next minute you concentrate, and so on. If you witness a traumatic or turbulent event through an impression, you lose concentration on the spell unless you succeed at a Will save with a DC of 30-35, depending on the severity of the event. The GM determines whether an event is traumatic and chooses the DC.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (8th) You gain impressions of events that occurred over the previous year for each minute you concentrate, instead of the previous day, though the details diminish, making it harder to distinguish impressions from all but the most major events.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (9th) You gain impressions of events that occurred over the previous century for each minute you concentrate, instead of the previous day, though the details diminish, making it almost impossible to distinguish impressions from all but the most major events.
REVERSE GRAVITY	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|7	INFO:Casting|Material Casting, Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:120 feet; Area 20-foot radius, 40-foot-tall cylinder	DURATION:1 minute	DESC:You reverse gravity in the area. Creatures and objects that aren't secured to the ground immediately fall upward to the top of the area. A creature might be able to Grab an Edge to arrest its fall if it falls past an appropriate edge. If a creature falls against a solid object (such as a ceiling), it takes the appropriate amount of falling damage and lands on the surface. Once an object or creature reaches the top of the area, it floats, caught between the normal and reversed gravity. The creature can move along the plane where the two forms of gravity meet. Creatures that can levitate or fly can use those abilities to mitigate the effects of reverse gravity. When reverse gravity ends, all creatures and objects caught in the area fall back down. Likewise, anything that moves beyond the bounds of the spell's area is subjected to normal gravity again.
REVIVAL	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|9	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:30 feet	TARGETAREA:dead creatures and living creatures of your choice in range	DURATION:concentration, up to 10 rounds	DESC:All living targets regain Hit Points equal to 9d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. In addition, you return any number of dead targets to life temporarily, with the same effects as raise dead and the same limitations. The resurrected creatures have a number of temporary Hit Points equal to the amount of healing you gave living creatures (instead of having full HP). The revived creatures can't regain Hit Points, and once revival's duration ends, they lose all temporary Hit Points and die. Revival can't resurrect creatures killed by disintegrate or a death effect. It has no effect on undead.
RIDICULOUS NOTION	TYPE:Power	INFO:PowerLevel|5	INFO:Casting|Verbal Casting	TARGETAREA:30-foot aura	DURATION:1 round	DESC:You speak a phrase so absurd that it can cause creatures to laugh. Each target must attempt a Will saving throw. A target is bolstered against your ridiculous notion once it succeeds at its save or once the duration ends if it fails the save.	DESC:&nl;Success Unaffected.	DESC:&nl;Failure -The target breaks into a paroxysm of laughter. It's slowed 1 and can't make reactions.	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure The target laughs so hard it falls prone and can't use any actions, reactions, or free actions.
RIGHTEOUS MIGHT	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|6	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting; Requirements You have a deity.	DURATION:1 minute or until dismissed	DESC:You focus all your divine energy into transforming yourself into a battle form, similar to your normal form but armed with powerful divine armaments granted by your deity. Your gear is absorbed into your form; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items. When you transform, you gain the following. • AC 27 (Touch 24) and ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction • A special attack with a righteous armament version of your favored weapon, which is the only type of attack you can use. When attacking with the special weapon, your attack modifier is +20 and your damage bonus is +4 (or +2 for a ranged attack). Use four of your weapon's normal damage dice, or one damage die higher if your weapon is a simple weapon with a d4 or d6 damage die. The weapon has one of the following properties that matches your deity's alignment: anarchic, axiomatic, holy, unholy. If your deity is true neutral, you instead gain access to the weapon's critical specialization effect. • 10 temporary Hit Points that go away when you leave your battle form. • Resistance 3 against physical damage. • Darkvision. • Speed of 40 feet. • Athletics +20 unless your own total modifier is higher. The special statistics of your battle form can be adjusted only by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses. Your battle form prevents you from casting spells or using most actions with the manipulate trait that require your hands (the GM determines which manipulate actions you can spend if there's doubt). You can dismiss this spell by using an action (this action has the concentrate trait).	DESC:&nl;Heightened (8th) Your battle form is Large, your attacks have 10-foot reach or 15-foot reach if your deity's favored weapon is a reach weapon. You must have enough space to expand into or the spell is lost. Your transformed statistics are as follows: AC 33 (Touch 29); attack modifier of +26; five dice of damage with a damage bonus of +5; 15 temporary HP; resistance 4 against physical damage; Athletics of +26.
ROPE TRICK	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|4	INFO:Casting|10 minutes (Material, Somatic, Verbal)	RANGE:touch	TARGETAREA:one touched piece of rope from 5 to 30 feet long	DURATION:8 hours	DESC:You cause the target rope to rise vertically into the air. Where it ends, an extradimensional space springs up, connected to the top of the rope. This space can be reached only by climbing the rope. The entrance to the space can't be seen, and it can be pinpointed only by the presence of the rope. The rope can't be removed or hidden, though it can be detached from the extradimensional space by pulling it with 16,000 pounds of weight, critically succeeding at an Athletics check against the spell's DC, or destroying the rope. The space holds up to eight Medium creatures and their gear. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and a Gargantuan creature fills the space on its own. If the rope is detached or destroyed or if a creature attempts to enter the space that would put it over its capacity, the space begins to unravel. It disappears in 1d4 rounds, depositing the creatures within safely on the ground below.
SAFEGUARD SECRET	TYPE:Power	INFO:PowerLevel|2	INFO:Casting|1 minute (Somatic, Verbal)	RANGE:10 feet	TARGETAREA:you and any willing allies	DESC:Choose one piece of information that at least some of the targets know; affected allies must remain within range for the full minute during which you cast the spell. This grants those who know the piece of knowledge you have chosen a +4 conditional bonus to skill checks (typically Deception checks) to conceal this knowledge and to saving throws against spells that specifically attempt to obtain this knowledge from them or against effects that would force them to reveal it. These bonuses last until you use this power again.
SANCTIFIED GROUND	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|3	INFO:Casting|1 minute (Material, Somatic, Verbal)	INFO:Cost|1 vial of holy water	TARGETAREA:30-foot burst centered on you	DURATION:24 hours	DESC:You sanctify the area, sprinkling it with holy water and preparing it to make a stand against your foes.

DESC:&nl;Critical Success Sanctuary is dismissed.	DESC:&nl;Failure -The creature can't attack the target and wastes the action. It can't attempt further attacks against the target this turn.	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure The creature wastes the action and can't attempt to attack the target for the rest of sanctuary's duration.
SAVOR THE STING	TYPE:Power	INFO:PowerLevel|1	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:touch	TARGETAREA:one creature	DESC:You revel in your target's pain. If you succeed at a touch attack, your target takes 1d6 mental damage (double damage on a critical hit) and becomes sick with pain depending on its Will save.

DESC:&nl;Failure -The target is sick 1 and takes 1 persistent mental damage as long as it's sick.	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure Per failure, but the target is sick 2.

Creatures are dazzled while inside the pattern. A creature must attempt a Will saving throw if it is inside the pattern when you cast it, enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently affected by the pattern doesn't need to attempt new saves.	DESC:&nl;Success Unaffected.	DESC:&nl;Failure -The target is confused for 1d4 rounds.	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure The target is stunned for 1d4 rounds. After the stun ends, the target is confused for the remaining duration of the spell.
SCRYING	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|6	INFO:Casting|10 minutes (Material, Somatic, Verbal)	RANGE:planetary	TARGETAREA:one creature	DURATION:concentration, up to 10 minutes	DESC:Scrying works like clairvoyance, except that the image you receive is less precise (insufficient for teleport and similar spells) and instead of creating an eye in a set location within 500 feet, you instead create an eye that appears just above the target. You can choose a target either by name or by touching one of its possessions or a fallen piece of its body. If you haven't met the target in person, scrying's DC is 2 lower, and if you are unaware of the target's identity (perhaps because you found an unknown creature's fang at a crime scene), the DC is instead 10 lower. The effect of scrying depends on the target's Will save.	DESC:&nl;Success The spell fails and the target is bolstered against scrying.	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The spell fails and the target is bolstered against scrying for 1 week. The target also gains a glimpse of you and learns its rough distance and direction from you.	DESC:&nl;Failure -The spell succeeds.	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure The spell succeeds, and the eye follows the target if it moves, traveling up to 60 feet per round.
SEARING LIGHT	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|3	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:120 feet	TARGETAREA:one creature	DESC:You shoot a blazing-hot ray of light tinged with holy energy. Make a ranged touch attack against the target. If you hit, you deal 4d6 fire damage. If the target is a fiend or undead, you deal 4d6 additional good damage to it. On a critical hit, double all the damage. If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, searing light attempts to dispel the darkness. If you need to determine whether the light passes through an area of darkness, draw a line between you and the spell's target.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (+2) The fire damage by 3d6 and the good damage against fiends and undead increases by 3d6.
SECRET PAGE	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|3	INFO:Casting|1 minute (Material, Somatic, Verbal)	RANGE:touch	TARGETAREA:one page up to 3 square feet in size	DURATION:unlimited	DESC:You change the target's text to different text entirely. If the text is a spellbook or a scroll, you can change it to show a spell you know of secret page's level or lower, though the replacement spell cannot be cast or used to prepare a spell. You can also transform the text into some other text you have written or have access to. You can specify a password that allows any creature touching the book to change the text back and forth. You must choose the replacement text and the password, if any, when you cast the spell.
SEE INVISIBILITY	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|2	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	DURATION:10 minutes	DESC:You can see invisible creatures and objects.

SHADOW WALK	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|5	INFO:Casting|1 minute (Material, Somatic, Verbal)	RANGE:touch	TARGETAREA:you and up to nine willing creatures touched	DURATION:8 hours or until dismissed	DESC:The targets enter the edge of the Shadow Plane, where it borders the Material Plane. Targets can't see the Material Plane while on the Shadow Plane, and while on the Shadow Plane, they are exposed to potential encounters with that plane's denizens. The shadows on the border between the planes bend space, speeding up your movement with respect to the Material Plane. Every 3 minutes the targets travel along this border, they move as far as they would through the Material Plane in 1 hour. At any point, a target can dismiss the spell's effects, although this affects only that target. The shadow bending is inexact, so when the spell ends, the targets appear roughly 1 mile from their intended location on the Material Plane (though those who are traveling together appear together).
SHAPE STONE	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|4	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:touch	TARGETAREA:cube of stone 10 feet across or smaller	DESC:You shape the stone into a rough shape of your choice; it can't include intricate parts, fine details, moving pieces, or the like.

SHIELD	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|Cantrip	INFO:Casting|Verbal Casting	DURATION:until your next turn or until dismissed	DESC:You raise a magical shield of force to protect you. This counts as using the Raise a Shield action (see the sidebar) to gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, though it doesn't require a hand to use. While the spell is in effect, you can also use the Shield Block reaction with your magic shield. The shield has Hardness 4. After you use Shield Block, the spell is dismissed and you can't cast it again for 10 minutes. Unlike a normal Shield Block, you can use the spell's reaction against the magic missile spell. Heightening the spell increases the Hardness.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (3rd) Hardness 10.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (5th) Hardness 15.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (7th) Hardness 20.

The target takes half damage from all sources that deal Hit Point damage, and you take the remainder of the damage. When you take damage through this link, don't apply any resistances, weaknesses, and the like that you have to that damage; you simple take that amount of damage. The spell is dismissed if the target is ever more than 30 feet away from you.
SHIFTING FORM	TYPE:Power	INFO:PowerLevel|4	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	DURATION:1 minute or until dismissed	DESC:You gain one of the following abilities of your choice.

The target can't use sonic attacks, nor can it use actions with the auditory trait. (This prevents it from casting spells that include Verbal Casting actions.)	DESC:&nl;Heightened (4th) The silence effect emanates from the touched creature, silencing all sound in or passing through a 10-foot radius and preventing any auditory and sonic effects in the affected area. While within the radius, creatures are subject to the effects listed above. Depending upon the position of the effect, a creature might be able to notice the lack of sound reaching it.

SPEAK WITH ANIMALS	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|2	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	DURATION:10 minutes	DESC:You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the Diplomacy skill with animals. The spell doesn't make them more friendly than normal. Wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive; less intelligent ones often make inane comments.
SPEAK WITH PLANTS	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|4	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	DURATION:10 minutes	DESC:You can ask questions of and receive answers from plants, but the spell doesn't make them more friendly or intelligent than normal. Most normal plants have a limited and distinctive view of the world around them, so they don't recognize details about creatures or know anything about the world beyond their immediate vicinity. Wary and cunning plant monsters are likely to be terse and evasive, while less intelligent ones often make inane comments.
SPECTRAL HAND	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|2	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:120 feet	DURATION:1 minute	DESC:You create a semicorporeal hand out of your essence that delivers touch spells for you. Whenever you Cast a Spell with a range of touch, you can have the hand crawl to a target within range along the ground, touch it, and then crawl back to you. When making a melee touch attack with the hand, you use your normal bonuses. The hand can move as far as it needs to within range, and its movement doesn't trigger reactions. The hand has your AC and saves, but any damage to the hand destroys it and causes you to take 1d6 damage.
SPELL IMMUNITY	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|4	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:touch	TARGETAREA:one creature	DURATION:24 hours	DESC:Choose a spell and name it aloud as part of the Verbal Casting action. Spell immunity attempts to dispel that spell (see page 197) whenever spell immunity's target is the target of the named spell or in that spell's area. Successfully dispelling a spell that targets an area or multiple targets with spell immunity negates the effects only for spell immunity's target.
SPELL TURNING	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|7	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	DURATION:1 hour	DESC:This abjuration reflects spells cast at you back at their caster. When a spell targets you, you can spend a reaction to have spell turning attempt to reflect it. This works like dispelling the spell, but if the spell is successfully dispelled, the effect is turned back on the caster. Whether or not the dispel attempt is successful, spell turning ends. Spell turning can't affect spells that aren't targeted (such as area spells). If spell turning reflects a spell back at a caster who also is under the effect of spell turning, his spell turning can attempt to reflect his own spell back at you again; if he does so, his dispel attempt automatically succeeds.
SPELLWRACK	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|6	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:30 feet	TARGETAREA:one creature	DESC:You cause any spells cast on the target to spill out their energy in harmful surges, depending on the target's Will save.

DESC:&nl;Failure -Whenever the target becomes affected by a spell with a duration, the target takes 1d12 persistent force damage, and each time she takes persistent force damage from spellwrack she reduces the remaining duration of spells affecting her by 1 round. An Arcana check at spellwrack's DC is required to lower the DC of the flat check for the persistent damage from 20 to 15.	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure Per failure, but the persistent force damage is 2d12.

SPIRIT BLAST	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|6	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:30 feet	TARGETAREA:one creature	DESC:You concentrate ethereal energy and attack a creature's spirit, dealing 12d6 force damage. It must attempt a Fortitude save. Because spirit blast affects the creature's spirit, it can damage a target projecting its consciousness or possessing another creature even if the target's body is elsewhere. The possessed creature isn't harmed by the blast. The blast doesn't harm creatures that have no spirit, such as constructs.	DESC:&nl;Success Half damage.	DESC:&nl;Critical Success No damage.

The results depend on the target's Will save. Any creature that casts a divine or occult spell on the target while it's affected must also attempt a Will save as if targeted, and the curse continues to spread in this way.	DESC:&nl;Success Enfeebled 2 for 1 round.	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The target is unaffected.	DESC:&nl;Failure -Enfeebled 2 for 1 minute, enfeebled 1 permanently.	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure Enfeebled 3 for 1 minute, enfeebled 2 permanently.
SPIRITUAL GUARDIAN	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|5	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting; Requirements You have a deity.	RANGE:120 feet	DURATION:concentration, up to 1 minute	DESC:A Medium guardian made of pure magical force manifests and attacks foes you designate within range. This guardian is ghostly and translucent and appears to be holding your deity's favored weapon. When you cast the spell, the spiritual guardian appears in an unoccupied space next to a foe of your choice within range and makes a Strike against it. Each time you Concentrate on the Spell, you can move the spiritual guardian to an unoccupied space next to a new target within range (if you choose to do so and make a Strike with it. The guardian uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty. Alternatively, when you Concentrate on the Spell, you can have the guardian move adjacent to an ally and protect that ally. If you do, each time the ally would take damage, the guardian takes the first 10 damage instead of your ally. It continues to do so until you move the guardian to attack an enemy or defend a different ally or until the guardian is destroyed (it has 30 Hit Points and can't recover Hit Points by any means). The guardian can't take damage except when protecting an ally, though disintegrate automatically destroys it if it hits the spiritual guardian's TAC of 25. Attacks with the guardian use your attack modifier with that type of weapon but use your spellcasting ability modifier instead of the normal ability modifier. Regardless of the weapon's appearance, the guardian deals force damage equal to 1d10 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. When you Strike with the guardian, you can choose to deal damage of the normal damage type of the weapon it holds instead of force damage (or any of the available damage types for a versatile weapon). No other attributes of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. A spiritual guardian's weapon counts as a weapon for triggers, resistances, and so forth. The guardian takes up space and grants flanking (even with a ranged weapon), but it doesn't have any other attributes a creature would normally have, aside from Hit Points, and creatures can move through its space without hindrance. The guardian can't make any kind of attack other than a normal Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons or enhance allies do not apply to the guardian's attacks.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (+2) The guardian's damage increases by 1d10 and its Hit Points increases by 10.

Each time you Concentrate on the Spell, you can move the weapon to a new target within range (if you choose to do so) and make a Strike with it. The spiritual weapon uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty. Attacks with the weapon use your attack modifier with that type of weapon, but substitute your spellcasting ability modifier instead of the normal ability modifier. Regardless of its appearance, the weapon deals force damage equal to 1d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. When you Strike with the weapon, you can deal damage of the normal damage type of the weapon instead of force damage (or any of the available damage types for a versatile weapon). No other attributes of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. A spiritual weapon counts as a weapon for triggers, resistances, and so forth. The weapon doesn't take up space, grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature would. The weapon can't make any kind of attack other than a normal Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons do not apply to this weapon.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (+2) The weapon's damage increases by 1d8.

While stone is not intelligent, you speak with the natural spirits of the stone, which have a personality colored by the type of stone, as well as by the type of structure the stone is part of, for worked stone. A stone's perspective, perception, and knowledge give it a worldview different enough from a human's that it doesn't consider the same details important. Stones can mostly answer questions about those that touched them in the past and what is concealed beneath them.

Each bolt deals 5d6 electricity damage ( half damage on a successful Reflex save, no damage on a critical success, and double damage on a critical failure). • Rain and Wind Heavy rain and whipping wind reduce visibility and mobility, making the area under the storm cloud concealed and difficult terrain. • Thunderclap Each creature in the storm must succeed at a Fortitude save or be deafened for 10 minutes. A creature that succeeds is bolstered against thunderclaps from the same storm of vengeance spell.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (10th) The range increases to 2,200 feet and the cloud is a 1,000-foot burst.

SYNESTHESIA	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|5	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:30 feet	TARGETAREA:one creature	DURATION:1 minute	DESC:The target's senses are acutely rewired in unexpected ways, causing them to process noises as bursts of color, smells as sounds, and so on. This has three effects, depending on the target's Will save. • Due to the distraction, the target must succeed at a DC 5 flat check each time it uses a concentrate action or reaction, or that action or reaction fails. • The reprocessing of the target's visual senses make all creatures and objects concealed from it. • The creature has trouble moving effectively, making it sluggish 3 and hampered 10 feet.	DESC:&nl;Success The target is affected for 1 round.	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The target is unaffected.	DESC:&nl;Failure -The target is affected for 1 minute.

This uses the physical body's latent memories rather than calling back the deceased's spirit, so the corpse must be mostly intact. The more damage it has taken, the more inaccurate or patchwork its answers, and it must have a throat and mouth to speak at all. If anyone has previously cast this spell on the corpse in the last week, the spell automatically fails. The corpse can attempt a Will save to resist the questions as if it were the original creature at its time of death, with the following effects.	DESC:&nl;Success The target can lie or refuse to answer your questions.	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The target can lie or refuse to answer your questions, and the target's spirit haunts you throughout the day, bothering you and causing you to be unable to gain any rest for 1 day.	DESC:&nl;Failure -The target must answer truthfully, but its answers can be brief, cryptic, and repetitive. It can still mislead you or attempt to stall so that the spell's duration runs out before you can ask all your questions.

Once per round, you can Concentrate on the Spell to have a vine lash out from any square within the expanse of creepers. This vine has a 15-foot reach and makes a melee touch attack using your bonus. If the attack succeeds, the vine pulls the target into the creepers and makes it immobile for 1 round or until the creature Escapes (using your spell DC as the Escape DC), whichever comes first.

TELEKINETIC PROJECTILE	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|Cantrip	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:30 feet	TARGETAREA:one creature	DESC:You hurl a loose, unattended object in range at the target. The spell gains the trait of a damage type appropriate to the object (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing). Make a ranged attack against the target. If you hit, you deal 1d10 damage of the given type; you deal double damage on a critical hit. No special traits or magic properties of the hurled item affect the attack or damage. You can heighten the spell to hurl more objects, though you attempt only one attack roll and target only one creature, and your salvo of projectiles deals damage all at once for the purposes of resistances, weaknesses, and the like. Only one damage type applies regardless of how many objects you hurl.	DESC:&nl;Success Full damage.	DESC:&nl;Critical Success Double damage.

Incorrect knowledge of the location's appearance usually causes the spell to fail, but it could lead to teleporting to an unwanted location or some other unusual mishap determined by the GM. Teleport is not precise over great distances. The targets appear at a distance from the intended destination equal to roughly 1% of the total distance traveled, in a direction determined by the GM. For short journeys, this lack of precision is irrelevant, but journeys of the maximum 100 miles are 1 mile off target.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (7th) You and the targets can travel to any location within 1,000 miles.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (8th) You and the targets can travel to any location on the same planet. If you travel more than 1,000 miles, you arrive only 10 miles off target.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (9th) You and the targets can travel to any location on another planet within the same solar system.

RANGE:120 feet	TARGETAREA:you or a willing ally in range	DESC:If the triggering saving throw's result is a success, it counts as a critical success. If it's a failure, it counts as a critical failure, and the critical failure can't be reduced by abilities that usually reduce critical failure, such as improved evasion. If the triggering ability did not have both a critical success and critical failure condition, tempt fate fails and your Spell Point is refunded.

While in tree form, you can observe everything around you, but you can't act other than by using an action (this action has the concentrate trait) to end the spell, which ends your turn. As a tree, your AC is 20; your TAC is 12; and only conditional bonuses, conditional penalties, circumstance bonuses, and circumstance penalties affect you. You treat successes and critical successes on Reflex saves as failures.
TREE STRIDE	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|5	INFO:Casting|1 minute (Material, Somatic, Verbal)	DESC:You step into a living tree with a trunk large enough to fit you and instantly teleport to any tree of the same species within 5 miles that also has a sufficiently large trunk. Once you enter the first tree, you instantly know the rough locations of other sufficiently large trees of the same species within range and can leave from the original tree, if you prefer.

They can perceive the creature or object perfectly, allowing them to ignore invisibility or the concealed condition, though physical barriers still provide cover. The tracking creatures can see the tracked creature or object through all barriers other than lead or running water, which block their vision. Distance also doesn't matter, though the creature or object might move so far away it becomes too small to perceive. You don't scry any of the environment around the creature or object, though you do see any gear a creature is wearing or holding and can tell if it removes objects from its person. If you try to track an unwilling creature, the effect depends on its Will save.	DESC:&nl;Success The spell ends after 1 round.	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The creature or object is unaffected.	DESC:&nl;Failure -The other targets track the creature or object.

The disguise can hide the targets' identities or let them appear to be of another ancestry, but it's not good enough to impersonate specific individuals. The spell doesn't change voice, scent, or mannerisms. You choose the disguise for each target, so you could make one appear to be a dwarf and another an elf, for example. Casting veil counts as setting up a disguise for the purpose of the Impersonate action. It ignores any circumstance penalties the targets might take for being disguised as a dissimilar creature, and it also gives the targets a +4 conditional bonus to Deception checks to prevent others from seeing through their disguises. You can dismiss any or all of these disguises with a Verbal Casting action.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (5th) The spell also disguises the targets' voices and scents, gaining the auditory trait.

VENTRILOQUISM	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|1	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	DURATION:1 minute	DESC:Whenever you speak, you can make your voice seem to come from somewhere else within 30 feet. Any creature that hears the sound can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (2nd) The spell's duration increases to 1 hour, and you can also change the tone, quality, and other aspects of your voice.

Creatures are dazzled while inside the pattern. A creature must attempt a Will saving throw if it's inside the pattern when you cast it, enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently blinded by the pattern doesn't need to attempt new saving throws.	DESC:&nl;Success Unaffected.	DESC:&nl;Failure -The target is blinded by the pattern.

VISIONS OF DANGER	TYPE:Spell.Arcane.Divine	INFO:SpellLevel|7	INFO:Casting|Material Casting, Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting	RANGE:500 feet; Area 30-foot burst	DURATION:1 minute	DESC:An illusion of horrific otherworldly creatures appears within the spell's area. The creatures look like Tiny swarming monsters, with a specific appearance of your choice, such as hellish flies or animated saw blades. Any creature that's inside the burst when it's created, enters the burst, or ends its turn inside the burst must attempt a Will save to avoid taking 8d8 mental damage. A creature that tries to Interact with the monsters or observes one with a Seek action can attempt to disbelieve the illusion.	DESC:&nl;Success Half damage.	DESC:&nl;Critical Success No damage, and the target can immediately attempt to disbelieve.	DESC:&nl;Failure -Full damage.	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure Double damage.	DESC:&nl;Heightened (+1) The mental damage increases by 1d8.

Creatures in the area must attempt a Reflex save or take 13d6 fire damage. The lava rapidly cools, and creatures in the area might become partially encased in rock depending on their Reflex saves. A creature encased in rock is sluggish 1, is hampered 5 feet, and when flying treats all normal terrain as difficult terrain. A flying creature immediately descends 20 feet the moment it's encased, but doesn't take falling damage from this movement.

The wall has AC 10, TAC 6, and Hardness 23, and it can take 3 additional Dents before being broken. If the wall is broken, the spell ends. The wall blocks physical effects from passing through it, and because it's made of force, it blocks incorporeal and ethereal creatures as well.

You mentally choose one creature when you name war, and the target instinctively knows which creature it is. This must be a creature both you and the target can see. If you name peace, the weapon Strikes the target each time the target acts in a hostile manner against you or one of your allies. You mentally choose up to five allies when you name peace, and the target instinctively knows who those allies are. The weapon Strikes only once per act, even if the act targets multiple allies. Attacks with the weapon use your attack modifier with that type of weapon, but they substitute your spellcasting ability modifier instead of the normal ability score. Regardless of its appearance, the weapon deals force damage equal to 3d10 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. The weapon takes a multiple attack penalty, but has its own rather than using yours. When you Strike with the weapon, you can deal damage of the normal damage type of the weapon instead of force damage (or any of the available damage types for a versatile weapon).
