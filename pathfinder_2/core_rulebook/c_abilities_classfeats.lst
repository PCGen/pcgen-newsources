This alchemical familiar appears to be a small creature of flesh and blood, though it might have some unusual or distinguishing aspects depending on your creative process.

SOURCEPAGE:p.77

DESC:You cause the bomb to create a cloud of thick smoke, in addition to its normal effects. When thrown, the bomb creates a cloud of smoke in a 10-foot-radius burst. You choose which corner of the target's space (or the space in which the bomb lands) the cloud is centered on. Creatures within that area have the concealed condition, and all other creatures are concealed to them. The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dissipated by a strong wind.	SOURCEPAGE:p.77
Calculated Splash		CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 04					PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=4	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=4	DESC:You have calculated all the angles to maximize a bomb's splash.

Efficient Alchemy		CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 04					PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=4	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=4	DESC:Thanks to the time you've spent studying and experimenting, you know how to scale your formulas into larger batches that don't require any additional attention. When spending downtime to Craft alchemical items, you can produce twice as many alchemical items in a single batch without spending additional preparatory time. For instance, if you are creating elixirs of life, you can craft up to eight elixirs in a single batch using downtime, rather than four. This does not reduce the amount of alchemical reagents required or other ingredients needed to craft each item, nor does it increase your rate of progress for days past the base downtime spent. This also does not change the number of items you can create in a batch using advanced alchemy.	SOURCEPAGE:p.77

The second elixir must also be at least 2 levels lower than your advanced alchemy level, and the combination elixir is an alchemical item two levels higher than the higher of the two elixirs' levels. When this combination elixir is consumed, both the constituent elixirs take effect. For example, you can combine two elixirs of life to create a combined elixir that heals twice the normal amount, or you can combine a lesser darkvision elixir with a lesser eagle-eye elixir to both gain darkvision and find secret doors.	SOURCEPAGE:p.78

DRAGON TRANSFORMATION	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feat.Class Feat	PRECLASS:1,Barbarian=16	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=16	PRETEXT:Prerequisites - dragon totem, Dragon Totem Wings	DESC:You transform into a Large form of a dragon that matches the dragon type of your dragon totem until you stop raging, gaining the dragon trait in addition to your normal traits while in this form. You must have enough space to expand into, or your transformation fails. All your gear is absorbed into your form; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any item abilities. When you transform, you gain the following. * Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction, if any. * One or more melee unarmed Strikes depending on your dragon form (see page 218), which are the only type of attacks you can use. You're trained with them. When attacking with them, your damage bonus is +6.

The saving throw is a Reflex save unless stated otherwise in the special ability description. Once you activate your breath weapon, you can't use it again for 1d4 rounds. Your breath weapon is an arcane evocation effect with the appropriate damage trait. The shape, damage, damage type, and saving throw type depend on your dragon form (see page 218). After you use your breath weapon, you still have to wait the full delay even if your transformation ends and you transform anew. The special statistics of your dragon form can be adjusted only by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses (such as those you gain while raging). Your dragon form prevents you from casting spells or taking most actions with the manipulate trait that require your hands. (The GM determines which actions you can use if there's any doubt.) You can dismiss this effect by spending an action (this action has the rage and concentrate traits). You gain the benefits for your chosen dragon's type listed in the dragon form spell (see page 218). At 18th level, your fly Speed is accelerated 20, your damage bonus increases to +12, your breath weapon DC increases to 30, and you gain a +14 conditional bonus to breath weapon damage.

The fissures are 40 feet deep, so anyone who falls in takes 20 bludgeoning damage. The fissures are permanent, and their walls require a DC 15 Athletics check to Climb. You automatically succeed at your saving throw to avoid any fissures you create. * Any structure or ceiling in the area has a chance to collapse. The GM makes a flat check for each structure, determining the DC for each (DC 16 for a sturdy structure, DC 14 for an average structure and most natural formations, DC 9 for a shoddy structure, or higher or lower as the GM sees fit). A collapse deals 11d6 bludgeoning damage; any creature caught in a collapse must attempt a Reflex save to escape it.	DESC:Success - Target takes half collapse damage and falls prone.
