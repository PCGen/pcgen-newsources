The familiar uses your Intelligence modifier to determine its Perception, Acrobatics, and Stealth modifiers (see Familiars on page 217 for more information).
Alchemical Savant			KEY:Alchemical Savant						SOURCEPAGE:p.76	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 01																PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=1	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1			PRETEXT:trained in Crafting					PREVARGTEQ:Prof_Rank_Crafting,1	DESC:You can identify alchemical items quickly.

Revivifying Mutagen		KEY:Revivifying Mutagen					SOURCEPAGE:p.77	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 02																PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=2	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=2																		DESC:While under the effect of a mutagen, you can metabolize that mutagen's power to heal yourself. This uses a single action, which has the concentrate and manipulate traits. Once the action is complete, you regain 1d6 Hit Points for every 2 item levels of the mutagen (minimum 1d6), but the mutagen's duration immediately ends, even if you are under the effect of Persistent Mutagen.
Smoke Bomb				KEY:Smoke Bomb							SOURCEPAGE:p.77	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 02.Free-Action.Additive 1												PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=2	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=2																		DESC:FREQUENCY - once per round	DESC:TRIGGER - You use Quick Alchemy to craft an alchemical bomb with a level at least 1 lower than your advanced alchemy level.	DESC:You cause the bomb to create a cloud of thick smoke, in addition to its normal effects. When thrown, the bomb creates a cloud of smoke in a 10-foot-radius burst. You choose which corner of the target's space (or the space in which the bomb lands) the cloud is centered on. Creatures within that area have the concealed condition, and all other creatures are concealed to them. The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dissipated by a strong wind.
Calculated Splash			KEY:Calculated Splash						SOURCEPAGE:p.77	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 04																PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=4	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=4																		DESC:You have calculated all the angles to maximize a bomb's splash.

When spending downtime to Craft alchemical items, you can produce twice as many alchemical items in a single batch without spending additional preparatory time. For instance, if you are creating elixirs of life, you can craft up to eight elixirs in a single batch using downtime, rather than four. This does not reduce the amount of alchemical reagents required or other ingredients needed to craft each item, nor does it increase your rate of progress for days past the base downtime spent. This also does not change the number of items you can create in a batch using advanced alchemy.
Enduring Alchemy			KEY:Enduring Alchemy						SOURCEPAGE:p.78	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 04																PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=4	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=4																		DESC:You've learned how to make your personal energy last just a little bit longer when quickly brewing ad hoc concoctions.

The second elixir must also be at least 2 levels lower than your advanced alchemy level, and the combination elixir is an alchemical item two levels higher than the higher of the two elixirs' levels. When this combination elixir is consumed, both the constituent elixirs take effect. For example, you can combine two elixirs of life to create a combined elixir that heals twice the normal amount, or you can combine a lesser darkvision elixir with a lesser eagle-eye elixir to both gain darkvision and find secret doors.

When throwing an alchemical bomb with the splash trait, instead of splashing all squares adjacent to the target, you can treat the target's space as the first affected square of a 15-foot cone directed away from you, potentially allowing you to avoid allies and splash deeper into enemy lines. If the target takes up more than a single square, the target's square closest to you is the first affected square of the cone.
Feral Mutagen			KEY:Feral Mutagen						SOURCEPAGE:p.79	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 08																PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=8	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=8																		DESC:Your bestial mutagen brings out the beast lurking within you, granting you especially sharp claws and teeth as well as a ferocious appearance.

Each spell in the combination must be 1 or more spell levels below the slot's level and both must target only one creature or object or have the option to target only one creature or object. Each spell in the combination must also have the same means of determining whether it has an effect-both spells must either require a ranged attack roll, the same type of saving throw, or automatically affect the target. When you cast a combined spell, it affects only one target, even if the component spells normally affect more than one target. If any spell in the combination has further restrictions (such as targeting only humanoids or only living creatures), you must abide by all restrictions. Handle the resolution of a combined spell as if were a single spell, but apply the effects of both component spells. For example, if the spell's target successfully saved against a combined spell, it would take the "Succeed" effect of each spell, and if it critically failed it would take the "Critical Failure" effect of both spells.
