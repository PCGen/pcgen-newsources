As long as you have the appropriate Crafting skill feat (such as Magical Crafting for magic items) and meet the item's level and proficiency requirement, you ignore just about any other requirement, such as being of a specific ancestry or providing spells. The only exceptions are requirements that add to the item's cost, including castings of spells that themselves have a cost, and requirements of special items such as the philosopher's stone that have exclusive means of access and Crafting. The GM decides whether you can ignore a requirement.
Diehard					SOURCEPAGE:260		CATEGORY:Feat		TYPE:General																																																												PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1																													DESC:It takes more to kill you than most. You die from the dying condition at dying 5, rather than dying 4.

Experienced Smuggler			SOURCEPAGE:261		CATEGORY:Feat		TYPE:General.Skill																																																											PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1						PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Stealth											PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Stealth,1		DESC:You often smuggle things past the authorities. When the GM rolls your Stealth check to see if a passive observer notices a small item you have concealed, the GM uses the number rolled or 10-whichever is higher-as the result of your die roll, adding it to your Stealth modifier to determine your Stealth check result. If you're a master in Stealth, the GM uses the number rolled or 15, and if you're legendary in Stealth, you automatically succeed at hiding a small concealed item from passive observers. This provides no benefits when a creature attempts a Perception check while actively searching you for hidden items.

If you succeed, the target is fascinated by you for 1 round. If the observer is in a situation that demands immediate attention, such as combat, you must critically succeed to fascinate it and the Perform action gains the incapacitation trait. You must choose which creature you're trying to fascinate before you roll your check, and the target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.&nl;If you're an expert in Performance, you can fascinate up to four observers; if you're a master, you can fascinate up to 10 observers; and if you're legendary, you can fascinate any number of observers at the same time.

Forager					SOURCEPAGE:261		CATEGORY:Feat		TYPE:General.Skill																																																											PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1						PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Survival											PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Survival,1	DESC:While using Survival to Subsist, if you roll any result worse than a success, you get a success. On a success, you can provide subsistence living for yourself and four additional creatures, and on a critical success, you can take care of twice as many creatures as on a success.&nl;Each time your proficiency rank in Survival increases, double the number of additional creatures you can take care of on a success (to eight if you're an expert, 16 if you're a master, or 32 if you're legendary). You can choose to care for half the number of additional creatures and provide a comfortable living instead of subsistence living.&nl;Multiple smaller creatures or creatures with significantly smaller appetites than a human are counted as a single creature for this feat, and larger creatures or those with significantly greater appetites each count as multiple creatures. The GM determines how much a non-human creature needs to eat.
Glad-Hand					SOURCEPAGE:261		CATEGORY:Feat		TYPE:General.Skill																																																											PREPCLEVEL:MIN=2						PRETEXT:Prerequisites expert in Diplomacy											PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Diplomacy,2	DESC:First impressions are your strong suit. When you meet someone in a casual or social situation, you can immediately attempt a Diplomacy check to Make an Impression on that creature rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. You take a -5 penalty to the check. If you fail or critically fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result.
Group Coercion				SOURCEPAGE:262		CATEGORY:Feat		TYPE:General.Skill																																																											PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1						PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Intimidation										PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Intimidation,1	DESC:When you Coerce, you can compare your Intimidation check result to the Will DCs of two targets instead of one.

You can Decipher Writing using Society while reading at normal speed. If you slow down and spend the full amount of time that's ordinarily required and roll a success, you get a critical success; if you critically succeed while spending the normal amount of time, you gain a nearly word-for-word understanding of the document.

Once per day for each target, you can spend 1 hour treating that target and attempt a Medicine check to remove a disease or the blinded, deafened, doomed, or drained condition.

NPCs who succeed at a DC 10 Society check to Recall Knowledge have heard of you and usually have an attitude toward you one step better than normal, depending on your reputation and the NPC's disposition. For instance, if you're well-known for cruel and demanding behavior, creatures might be intimidated by you, rather than be friendly toward you. When you Earn Income with Performance, you attract higher-level audiences than your location would allow, as audiences flock to see you. For instance, rulers and angels might travel to your small tower in the woods to hear you perform. Typically, this increases the audiences available by 2 levels or more, determined by the GM.

You must do so slowly and carefully, spending at least 1 minute (and significantly longer for items that are normally time consuming to remove, like armor). Throughout this duration you must have some means of staying hidden, such as the cover of darkness or a bustling crowd. You take a -5 penalty to your Thievery check. Even if you succeed, if the item is extremely prominent-like a suit of full plate armor-onlookers will quickly notice it's gone after you steal it.
Lengthy Diversion				SOURCEPAGE:263		CATEGORY:Feat		TYPE:General.Skill																																																											PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1						PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Deception										PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Deception,1	DESC:When you critically succeed to Create a Diversion, you continue to remain hidden after the end of your turn.

If you can engage in conversation with someone trying to Lie to you, use your Deception DC if it is higher than your Perception DC to determine whether they succeed. This doesn't apply if you don't have a back-and-forth dialogue, such as when someone attempts to Lie during a long speech.
Magical Crafting				SOURCEPAGE:263		CATEGORY:Feat		TYPE:General.Skill																																																											PREPCLEVEL:MIN=2						PRETEXT:Prerequisites expert in Crafting											PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Crafting,2	DESC:You can Craft magic items, though some have other requirements, as listed in Chapter 11.

If you're a master in the tradition's associated skill, learning a spell takes 5 minutes per spell level, and if you're legendary, it takes 1 minute per spell level. You can use downtime to learn and inscribe new spells. This works as if you were using Earn Income with the tradition's associated skill, but instead of gaining money, you choose a spell available to you to learn and gain a discount on learning it, learning it for free if your earned income equals or exceeds its cost.

You can't steal objects that would be extremely noticeable or time consuming to remove (like worn shoes or armor or actively wielded objects). If you're a master in Thievery, you can attempt to Steal from a creature in combat or otherwise on guard. When doing so, Stealing requires 2 manipulate actions instead of 1, and you take a -5 penalty.

The highest level of spell you automatically identify increases to 4 if you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 10 if you're legendary. The GM rolls a secret Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion check, whichever corresponds to the tradition of the spell being cast.

If you roll a critical failure at a Religion check to Decipher Writing of a religious nature or to Recall Knowledge about the tenets of faiths, you get a failure instead. When attempting to Recall Knowledge about the tenets of your own faith, if you roll a failure, you get a success instead, and if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.
Subtle Theft				SOURCEPAGE:267		CATEGORY:Feat		TYPE:General.Skill																																																											PREPCLEVEL:MIN=1						PRETEXT:Prerequisites trained in Thievery											PREVARGTEQ:Modifier_Thievery,1	DESC:When you successfully Steal something, observers (creatures other than the creature you stole from) take a -2 circumstance penalty to their Perception DCs to detect your theft.

You must know what activating the item does, or you can't attempt to trick it.&nl;Attempt a check using the skill matching the item's magic tradition, or matching a tradition that has the spell on its list, if you're trying to cast a spell from the item. The relevant skills are Arcana for arcane, Nature for primal, Occultism for occult, Religion for divine, or any of the four for an item that has the magical trait and not a tradition trait. The GM determines the DC based on the item's level (possibly adjusted depending on the item or situation).&nl;If you activate a magic item that requires a spell attack roll or spell DC and you don't have the ability to cast spells of the relevant tradition, use your level as your proficiency bonus and the highest of your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifiers. If you're a master in the appropriate skill for the item's tradition, you instead use the trained proficiency bonus, and if you're legendary, you instead use the expert proficiency bonus. &nl; - Success For the rest of the current turn, you can spend actions to activate the item as if you could normally use it. &nl; - Failure You can't use the item or try to trick it again this turn, but you can try again on subsequent turns. &nl; - Critical Failure You can't use the item, and you can't try to trick it again until your next daily preparations.
