Even on a successful Perception check, any foe that can’t be seen still has total concealment (50%% miss chance) against a copaxi, and the copaxi still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment.

A copaxi can treat high or low gravity as standard gravity or treat standard gravity as high or low gravity. These adjustments only affect the copaxi and anything the copaxi is carrying; they do not affect thrown weapons. The copaxi cannot adjust to or from extreme or zero gravity.

They must have qualified for any new selections at the retrained level.																																													SOURCELONG:SFS Scenario #1-22
