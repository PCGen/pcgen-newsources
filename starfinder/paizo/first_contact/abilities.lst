Cloaking Field (Ex): The operative can bend light around herself and muffle the sounds of her breathing, heartbeat, and movements, allowing her to nearly vanish when she isn't moving. Even when she moves, she appears as only an outline with blurry features. This cloaking field doesn't make the operative invisible, but it does make it easier for her to sneak around. Activating the cloaking field is a move action. While the cloaking field is active, the operative can use Stealth to hide, even while being directly observed and with no place to hide. Attacking doesn't end the cloaking field, but it does end that particular attempt to hide. If the operative remains perfectly still for at least 1 round, she gains a +10 bonus to Stealth checks (which doesn't stack with the bonus from invisibility) until she moves. The operative's cloaking field lasts for up to 10 rounds before it becomes inactive. While inactive, the cloaking field automatically recharges from the kinetic energy of the operative's movements. As long as she is moving, it recharges at the rate of 1 round of cloaking per minute.

Debilitating Trick (Ex): At 4th level, the operative gains the ability to debilitate her foes. When she hits an enemy with a trick attack (see below), that enemy incurs a debilitating effect until the beginning of the operative's next turn. The operative can choose to make the creature flat-footed or off-target (-2 penalty to attack rolls).

Grenade Expert (Ex): This increases the range increment of the soldier's thrown grenades by the listed amount. The soldier can also spend 10 minutes to create any level 1 grenade without paying for it. Only the soldier can use this grenade-it's a dud for anyone else. The soldier can have only one grenade created by this ability at a time.

Trick Attack (Ex): The operative can trick a foe and then attack when that enemy drops his guard. As a full action, the operative can move up to her speed. Whether or not she moved, she can then make an attack with a small arm or a melee weapon with the operative special feature. Just before making the attack, the operative attempts a Bluff, Intimidate, or Stealth check with a DC equal to 20 + the target's CR or character level. If she succeeds, the target is flat-footed against that attack and the operative deals the listed amount of additional damage; even if the target is immune to being flat-footed, the operative still deals the extra damage. The operative can't use this ability with a weapon that has the slow-firing special feature or otherwise requires a full action to fire once.

Uncanny Mobility (Ex): When the operative uses the trick attack ability, her movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity from the target of her attack. In order to benefit from this ability, the operative must choose the target of her attack before she moves. Also, when the operative uses a standard action to move, she can choose one creature. She doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity from that creature for this movement.


###Block - Universal Monster Rules
Limited Telepathy (Su): The creature can project its speech telepathically into the mind of any creature within the listed distance, but it can still communicate only in languages it knows.
Unliving (Ex): A construct or undead has no Constitution modifier and is immediately destroyed when it reaches 0 Hit Points. An unliving creature doesn't recover from damage naturally, but a construct can be repaired with the right tools. Spells like make whole can heal constructs, and negative energy can heal undead. An unliving creature with fast healing benefits from that ability. Unliving creatures don't breathe, eat, or sleep. They can't be raised or resurrected.
