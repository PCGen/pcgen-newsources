###Block - WEAPON ABILITIES
# From standard abilities to critical hit effects, the following rules are associated with weapons.
Arc		TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:On a critical hit, the attack's energy leaps to a second creature. This must be within 10 feet of the target creature and must be the nearest creature to it (if multiple creatures are equidistant, the wielder chooses the secondary target). The secondary creature takes the listed amount of damage of the same type the weapon deals.
Burn		TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:On a critical hit, the target takes burn damage equal to the amount listed for an additional 1d4 rounds at the start of its turn. A burning creature can put out the fire as a full action.
Explode	TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:Explosives have the explode ability, which lists the radius of the explosion, the amount of damage it deals, and the damage type. The user of a weapon with this ability aims at a grid intersection. Each creature within the blast radius takes the listed damage unless it succeeds at a Reflex save at the listed DC, in which case it takes half damage. Any penalties to weapon attack rolls reduce this DC.
