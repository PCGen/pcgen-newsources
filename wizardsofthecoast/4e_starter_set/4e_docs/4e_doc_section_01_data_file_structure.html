	<h1>PCGen 4E Data Set Creation: Data File Structure</h1>
	
	<p class="indent0">In order to have pcgen load your files you must follow certain standards.</p>

	<p class="indent0">For our data set, you must keep them organized and easy to find.</p>

	<p class="indent0">Naming conventions are essential to good organization and grouping.</p>

	<p class="indent0">Today we will expand that to making homebrew sets, mainly 4th edition.</p>

	<p class="indent0">To start locate your pcgen folder (default windows is c:/program files/pcgen/pcgenxxxx/) 
		Inside the pcgen folder is the version you are using, and then a dir structure as with our focus on these two:</p>

	<ul class="indent0">
		<li style="list-style-type: none">data - where we hold the book information in the form of lst and pcc fils.
		<li style="list-style-type: none">system - where we will have the gamemode inforamtion
	</ul>

	<h3>The Data Folder</h3>

	<p class="indent0">We will focus first on the data folder. Inside PCGen's data folder 
		you will see the following subfolders:</p>

	<dl class="indent1">
		<dt><em>alpha</em></dt>
			<dd>This folder is where PCGen's 'alpha' data sets are found.</dd>
		<dt><em>customsources</em></dt>
			<dd>This folder is where data sets created by PCGen's LST Editor are stored.</dd>
		<dt><em>d20ogl</em></dt>
			<dd>This folder is where PCGens officially distributed data sets are found.</dd>
		<dt><em>my_dataset</em></dt>
			<dd>This folder is where 'homebrew' data sets are generally placed.</dd>
		<dt><em>publisher_logos</em></dt>
			<dd>This folder contains publisher logo artwork which is displayed in PCGen's 'Source Information Panel'</dd>
	</dl>

	<p class="indent0">I suggest you create a new folder called 'homebrew' and inside your 
		new homebrew folder create a folder called '4e'.</p>

	<p class="indent0">I like simple names but you can be as elaborate as you wish. I suggest that 
		you use the underscore (_) as a substitute for the space in your folder name so if, for 
		example, you use '4th_edition' as your folder name you won't have issues referencing it 
		in the future.</p>

	<p class="indent0">Inside your newly created folder, henceforth called the 4e folder, we will create 
		the required text files using the following naming convention: gamemode_lsttype.extension.</p>

	<p class="sidebar1">There are two extension that are used in data files. These are the &quot;,pcc&quot; 
		and the &quot;.lst&quot; extensions.<br>
		- the .pcc is the control file that pcgen will use to identify all lst files to be used in a campaign.<br>
		- the .lst file is our basic file format for the data files that define the objects, e.g. classes, races, feats, etc. used within PCGen.</p>

	<p class="indent0">Examples of the files you will be creating are as follows:

	<ul class="indent0">
		<li style="list-style-type: none">4e.pcc</li>
		<li style="list-style-type: none">4e_classes.lst</li>
		<li style="list-style-type: none">4e_races.lst</li>
		<li style="list-style-type: none">4e_abilities.lst</li>
		<li style="list-style-type: none">4e_feats.lst</li>
		<li style="list-style-type: none">4e_equipment.lst</li>
		<li style="list-style-type: none">4e_languages.lst</li>
		<li style="list-style-type: none">4e_skills.lst</li>
		<li style="list-style-type: none">4e_kits.lst</li>
		<li style="list-style-type: none">4e_profs_armor.lst
		<li style="list-style-type: none">4e_profs_shields.lst
		<li style="list-style-type: none">4e_profs_weapons.lst
	</ul>

	<p class="indent0">You will need at least one file of each kind.</p>

	<h3>System Folder and the GameMode Files</h3>
	
	<p class="indent0">GameMode file structure info goes here.</p>
