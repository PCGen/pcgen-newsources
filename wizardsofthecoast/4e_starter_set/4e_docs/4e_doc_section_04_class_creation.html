		<h1>PCGen 4E Data Set Creation: Classes</h1>
	
		<p class="indent0">Greetings, this is the 4e based Class Guide. You will find on this page information that will help 
			you create your own basic character classes as well as monster classes.</p>

<hr>

		<h2>Basic Class Creation</h2>
		
		<p class="indent0">Okay, in this section we will illustrate what you'll need to make characters based upon the 
			4th edition rules.</p>

		<p class="indent0">If you've read our basic class section then most of this will be a refresher.</p>

		<p class="indent0">First off, we need to know what we are making. I will be making my 
			<span class="lstobj">Monkey Warrior</span> (King of the Data Monkeys) who will have several 
			possible combo of tags you could need to make your own classes. Common sense will dictate which 
			tags are optional, plus I'll let you know which ones are very optional.</p>


		<p class="indent0">To get started let's open the file <span class="lstfile">4e_classes.lst</span> found in our 
			4e_starter folder.</p>

		<p class="indent0">Once the file is open with a text editor I will need to enter the basic and advanced 
			class information. PCGen requres the use of 'Tags' to achieve this. I'd encourage you to become 
			familiar with those tags as we go along.</p>

		<p class="sidebar1">NOTE: This symbol '&lt;&gt;' indicates a TAB, we default the Tab spacing to 6 for our 
			official lst files.</p>

<hr>

		<h3>Class Line vs Class Level Line</h3>

		<p class="indent0">We need to know where certain tags go, we have two basic types - Class Line and Class Level 
			Line. A line is always on the same "line" with TABs providing the spacing. A Class line MUST always start 
			with a <code>CLASS</code> tag.</p>

		<p class="indent1"><strong>Example of Class Line</strong></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>CLASS:Monkey Warrior &lt;tab&gt; BONUS:CHECKS|Fortitude|3|TYPE=Class</code></p>
		<p class="indent3">A class line is any line preceeded with the 'CLASS' tag.</p>

		<p class="indent1"><strong>Example of a Class Level Line</strong></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>1 &lt;tab&gt; BONUS:CHECKS|Fortitude|3|TYPE=Class</code></p>
		<p class="indent3">A Class Level line is any line preceeded by a number indicating a class level, in this case a 
			&quot;1&quot;, must ALWAYS come after a CLASS line. That way the program knows which class gets what at each 
			level.</p>

		<p class="indent0">The following will go on our class line:</p>
		<blockquote class="indent0">
			<p class="indent2"><code>CLASS:Monkey Warrior</code></p>
			<p class="indent3">This is the name of the Class and how it will be referenced from now on.</p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>OUTPUTNAME:Warrior</code></p>
			<p class="indent3">Optional, but allows me to customize the name of the class if I need too. In this case 
				I will see the name 'Warrior'. The class is still Monkey Warrior, but on the PDF and in the GUI (Graphic 
				User Interface) I will see it only as 'Warrior'</p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>HD:1</code></p>
			<p class="indent3">This tag sets my HD. At each level this is the dice that will be rolled, max or averaged, 
				in this case 1d1. I set this to 1 for now. We will cover the intricacies of HP in the 4th ed environment 
				later on...</p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>TYPE:Base.PC</code></p>
			<p class="indent3">This tells the program that this is a Base Class and also a PC class. Other Choices are 
				Monster and NPC. For 4e, I don't see the need for NPC.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p></p>
		<p class="indent0">Next, I want my <span class="lstobj">Monkey Warrior</span> to have a Great Fortitude Save 
			of &quot;+3&quot;. For this we'll use the following tag:</p>
		<p></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>BONUS:CHECKS|Fortitude|3|TYPE=Class</code></p>
		<p class="indent3">This grants +3 to my Fortitude Save with a type &quot;Class&quot;, which will allow it to 
			be tracked properly on the output sheet (OS). This tag can be placed on a Class line or a Class Level line.</p>

		<p class="indent2"><code>PREMULT:1,[PRECLASS:1,Monkey Warrior=1],[!PRECLASS:1,ANY]</code></p>
		<p class="indent3">This says I can take the character class <span class="lstobj">Monkey Warrior</span>, and 
			nothing else. This prevents me from taking any class except this class once I take it. Until then I may 
			choose another class.</p>

		<p class="indent0">The rest will go on Class Level lines.</p>
		<blockquote class="indent0">
			<p class="indent2"><code>1 &lt;tab&gt; ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Monkey Warrior Proficiencies</code></p>
			<p class="indent3">At first level the character will recieve the Monkey Warrior Proficiencies ability (which 
				is part of the Special Ability Category. We cover abilities in another class. PCGen is modular, so things 
				will reference other files.)</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="indent0">My Monkey warrior has 20 + his con score for starting HP and then every level beyond first he gains 10 hp
		<p class="indent0">So in order to make that work I would use
		<p class="indent1"><code>1 &lt;tab&gt; BONUS:HP|CURRENTMAX|20+CONSCORE</code></p>
		<p class="indent2">Monkey Warrior will gain 20 plus his Constitution Score at first level </p>
		<p class="indent1"><code>2 &lt;tab&gt; BONUS:HP|CURRENTMAX|(CL-1)*10</code></p>
		<p class="indent2">This will grant 10 hp per level except for first level (CL = Class Level - 1, so at 1st 
			level this would be 0). I put it on the 2nd level line just to keep a clean look.</p>

		<p class="indent1"><code>1 &lt;tab&gt; TEMPLATE:ClassGrantedTotalLevels</code></p>
		<p class="indent2">- I like names that I understand what the purpose is, in this case we know that this 
			template deals with Class Granted Total Levels, which is that stuff which happens regardless of my class. 
			A template is a very useful tool. It can change your racetype or bestow certain hitdice or many other uses. 
			You could very easily implment this tag as an ability by using:</p>
		<blockquote class="indent1">
			<p class="indent1"><code>1 &lt;tab&gt; ABILITY:Special Ability|ClassGrantedTotalLevels</code></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="indent2">But if you do that you will need to create the additional ability, instead of the 
		Template. (This is an example of PCGen's flexibility and possible confusion when things become complex.)</p>

		<p class="indent1"><code>1 &lt;tab&gt; BONUS:VAR|HealingSurges|20+CON|TYPE=Class</code></p>
		<p class="indent2">This game system uses the variable called "HealingSurges" to be consistent, we have to 
			actually use that name.</p>
		<p class="indent2">Monkey Warrior gets 20 plus his Constitution Bonus of that power. Cool... (I suspect Monkey 
			Warrior is a One Monkey Wrecking Ball).</p>


		<p class="indent1"><code>1 &lt;tab&gt; BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Monkey Warrior Class Skills|1</code></p>
		<p class="indent2">- When we set up Skills, this will make sense, monkey warrior only gets one skill to choose from.</p>

		<p class="indent1"><code>1 &lt;tab&gt; ABILITY:FEAT|AUTOMATIC|Skill Training (Monkey Lore)</code></p>
		<p class="indent2">- Monkey Warrior is granted the Feat - 'Skill Training (Monkey Lore)' automatically.</p>
		<p class="indent2">You can also use AUTO:FEAT|Skill Training (Monkey Lore) to accomplish the same thing in this case.</p>

		<p class="indent1"><code>1 &lt;tab&gt; ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Monkey Warrior Weapon Proficiencies|Monkey 
			Warrior Armor Proficiencies</code></p>
		<p class="indent2">- These tell pcgen to grab those abilities... Which we will setup which proficiencies the 
			Monkey Warrior knows.</p>

		<p class="indent1"><code>1 &lt;tab&gt; ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Monkey Warrior Fu|Monkey Warrior Percent 
			Chance to find Fleas|Monkey Warrior Banana Fling</code></p>
		<p class="indent2">- I like keeping the proficiencies separate, but here is Monkey Warrior's Class Abilities. 
			(Not powers, let's keep that distinction clear).</p>

<hr>

		<h3>Class Ability Advances by Level</h3>

		<p class="indent0">Finally some advanced people will like to track class based things. As an example:</p>
		<p class="indent1">At 1<sup>st</sup> - 10<sup>th</sup> level <span class="lstobj">Monkey Warrior</span> can fling bananas that can 
			do an extra 1d10 damage (Hey, he has big bananas!).</p>
		<p class="indent1">At 11<sup>th</sup> to 20<sup>th</sup> his bananas do 2d10 damage.
		<p class="indent1">Finally, at 21<sup>st</sup> to 30<sup>th</sup> level he's mastered the banana flinging so well that 
			he does 4d10 damage.</p>
		<P class="indent0">To track this additional damage, you can either note that damage in his ability, or PCGen can 
			calculate that damage for you. To do this, we use two tags. The <code>DEFINE</code> and the <code>BONUS:VAR></code> 
			tags. We will place the <code>BONUS:VAR></code> tag on the Class Level line, but the <code>DEFINE</code> tag will 
			need to be included in his ability.</p>

		<p class="indent0">The following goes on the <span class="lstobj">Monkey Warrior</span> Class Level lines:</p>
		<p class="indent1"><code>1 &lt;tab&gt; BONUS:VAR|BanannaFlingDamage|1</code></p>
		<p class="indent2">This will add &quot;1&quot; to the variable called &quot;BanannaFlingDamage&quot;. Since our 
			<code>DEFINE</code> tag is set to zero, the new value will be equal to one.</p>
		<p class="indent1"><code>11 &lt;tab&gt; BONUS:VAR|BanannaFlingDamage|1</code></p>
		<p class="indent2">Adds another 1 to the same variable name. (0+1+1 =2)</p>
		<p class="indent1"><code>21 &lt;tab&gt; BONUS:VAR|BanannaFlingDamage|2</code></p>
		<p class="indent2">Adds 2 to the variable name (0+1+1+2=4)</p>

<hr>

		<h3>The Final Product: The Monkey Warrior</h3>

		<p class="indent0">Here is my final Monkey Warrior with all the completed stuff, does yours look the same?
		<blockquote class="indent0">
			<p class="indent2"><code>CLASS:Monkey Warrior &lt;tab&gt; HD:1 &lt;tab&gt; TYPE:Base.PC &lt;tab&gt; 
				BONUS:CHECKS|Fortitude|3|TYPE=Class &lt;tab&gt; 
				PREMULT:1,[PRECLASS:1,Monkey Warrior=1],[!PRETYPE:1,PC]</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>1 &lt;tab&gt; BONUS:HP|CURRENTMAX|20+CONSCORE</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>2 &lt;tab&gt; BONUS:HP|CURRENTMAX|(CL-1)*10</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>1 &lt;tab&gt; BONUS:VAR|HealingSurges|10+CON|TYPE=Class</code></p>	
			<p class="indent2"><code>1 &lt;tab&gt; BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Monkey Warrior Class Skills|3</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>1 &lt;tab&gt; ABILITY:FEAT|AUTOMATIC|Skill Training (Monkey Lore)</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>1 &lt;tab&gt; TEMPLATE:ClassGrantedTotalLevels</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>1 &lt;tab&gt; ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Monkey Warrior Weapon 
				Proficiencies|Monkey Warrior Armor Proficiencies</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>1 &lt;tab&gt; ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Monkey Warrior Fu|Monkey 
				Warrior Percent Chance to find Fleas|Monkey Warrior Bananna Fling</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>1 &lt;tab&gt; BONUS:VAR|BanannaFlingDamage|1</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>11 &lt;tab&gt; BONUS:VAR|BanannaFlingDamage|1</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>21 &lt;tab&gt; BONUS:VAR|BanannaFlingDamage|2</code></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p></p>

		<p class="indent0">That concludes Monkey Warrior. I won't be able to use Monkey Warrior until we finalize a few more files, so you'll need to be patient.

		<p class="indent0">If you made it to this point, congratulations, you've completed the Basic Class for Character Creation.


<hr>

		<h2>Monster Class Creation</h2>

		<p class="indent0">Making monsters is not hard, in fact they are fairly easy once you get to </p>

		<p class="indent0">Okay, Monsters have specific classes or functions. Today I'll make a nasty one I'll call 
			<span class="lstobj">Monkey Destroyer</span>.</p>
		<p></p>

		<p class="indent1"><code>CLASS:Monkey Destroyer</code></p>
		<p class="indent2">This is the name of the class.</p>

		<p class="indent1"><code>TYPE:Monster</code></p>
		<p class="indent2">Important that we make any monster types as such.</p>

		<p class="indent1"><code>PREMULT:1,[PRECLASS:1,Monkey Destroyer],[PREPCLEVEL:MAX=1]</code></p>
		<p class="indent2">This is optional, but if I want to restrict monsters I can use this.	</p>

		<p class="indent1"><code>BONUS:COMBAT|INITIATIVE|10</code></p>
		<p class="indent2">Monkey Destroyer is a nasty boy that has a plus 10 to his initiative check.</p>

		<p class="indent1"><code>BONUS:HP|CURRENTMAX|20+CON+(CL*20)</code></p>
		<p class="indent2">Monkey Destroyer has 20 HP plus his CON bonus plus 20 each level.</p>

		<p class="indent1"><code>BONUS:COMBAT|AC|CL+20</code></p>
		<p class="indent2">Monkey Destroyer have an AC Defense Bonus of 20 plus 1 per level</p>

		<p class="indent1"><code>BONUS:CHECKS|ALL|CL+20</code></p>
		<p class="indent2">Monkey Destroyer has all his "defenses" at 20 plus his level (Which does not include the 10 base).</p>

		<p class="indent1"><code>BONUS:COMBAT|BAB|CL+20</code></p>
		<p class="indent2">Monkey Destroyer is a heavy combat machine. He has an attack bonus of 20 plus his level</p>

		<p class="indent1"><code>BONUS:VAR|OtherBAB|CL+10</code></p>
		<p class="indent2">Monkey Destroyer does very well when he attacks other defense types. (This is a separate 
			variable that will only been seen if you set up a proper ability).</p>

		<p class="indent1"><code>ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|OtherBAB</code></p>
		<p class="indent2">This calls an ability automatically called 'OtherBAB', we will need to set this up later.</p>

		<p class="indent1"><code>BONUS:VAR|HealingSurges|5</code></p>
		<p class="indent2">Monkey Destroyer is a feared creature, he gets 5 uses of the HealingSurge variable.</p>

		<p class="indent0">Here is what <span class="lstobj">Monkey Destroyer</span> looks like</p>
		<blockquote class="indent1">
			<p class="tagindent1"><code>CLASS:Monkey Destroyer &lt;tab&gt; TYPE:Monster &lt;tab&gt; 
				PREMULT:[PRECLASS:1,Monkey Destroyer],[PREPCLEVEL:MAX=1] &lt;tab&gt; BONUS:COMBAT|INITIATIVE|10 &lt;tab&gt; 
				BONUS:HP|CURRENTMAX|20+CON+(CL*20) &lt;tab&gt; BONUS:COMBAT|AC|CL+20 &lt;tab&gt; BONUS:CHECKS|ALL|CL+12 &lt;tab&gt;
